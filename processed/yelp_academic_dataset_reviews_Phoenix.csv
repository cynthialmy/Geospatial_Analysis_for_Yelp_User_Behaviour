2403485,0,2,AlmqITxMDiP_XdH_EiHO2A,"I had a great experience with these guys yesterday.  I was having some issues with my phone where the display was acting really weird.  I posted something on facebook asking for recommendations of someone that would fix it.  I got back a couple of responses but wasn't thrilled about any of them because of either distance or price.  A coworker recommended I look on Craigslist so I checked there and there were several options and I called either 5 or 6 of them.  I got a hold of three of them and they were all less expensive than the recommended ones I got from Facebook.  The cheapest option I found was for $65 but I had to take it them and they were about 12 miles away. Then I called Phone Savers and I'm glad I did.  They were only $70 and they came to me.  They had an open time slot about 90 minutes after I called and he told me they were very punctual so I should be aware.  He actually showed up about 10 minutes early which was nice.  I showed him what my phone was doing and he thought it just needed a new lcd digitizer or something like that.  Another great thing is that when I explained what was going on over the phone he said it could probably be about 3 different things but most likely the digitizer.  But he said that if he got out here and put in the new digitizer and screen still didn't work then there wouldn't be a charge.  I figured I didn't have anything to lose.  Anyway, he came out, sat in his car for about 15 minutes and then it was done.  There was even a deal going on on Yelp where you could buy a $20 credit with them for $10 so I actually only paid $60.  So, they came to me, fixed it perfectly and it only cost me $60.  I couldn't be happier and would highly recommend them.

Lots of turnover in their selection, nice high test thc buds, and the best selection of vape carts currently available.  They started a little high at $70/cart, but the price has slowly come down and is currently $55.  That's still not as good as other states, but in NJ right now, it's the best you are going to find.  They also have products the other shops aren't offering like the lozenges.  I think they taste terrible, but if that's your thing they are here.

They run a lot of sales here, so $90 1/4's are not uncommon, and anyone that's in the program knows that's cheap for NJ.  It was not so hard to get a consult, and once you do it you can pop in whenever you want.  

My only real problem here is that they cater to a LOT of people because there is not another shop close, so weekends can be busy.  I am immunocompromised from chemo, so standing in a waiting room with 50 people isn't really the best activity, but the turnover was pretty quick.

Finally made it in, met with consultant. The man knew his stuff, was quick as he saw I was agitated and answered any questions I had. 

The product is great, I don't need to use as much and does the job.",ZWt__3MBepCHn-lCo9sTCQ,3.0,2019-01-07 19:55:20,B1TzSQhpLs9UvgnjjwRK8Q,1,2019-01-07 19:55:20

4125602,1,7,ldWYIS_vXimrpXnVRb3yJw,"I'm unsure what all the negative customer reviews are for. I found the staff helpful, friendly, and worked quickly to get me my medicine. 

My counselor, Dana, was very thorough with my consultation and I learned a lot that I didn't realize about cannabis, the strains, the canniboids and the different products. 

I came in at the same time the Eagles were playing, so it was apparently ""slow"". Normally, you should expect to have anywhere from a 15min - 1hr wait in high traffic times. Come prepared and remember that everyone will get out with the medicine they want and need. 

While there, I was exposed to some pretty entitled and rude patients acting as if they should get immediate service and behaving like they were going through withdrawal. ""I could get better service from the street"". Well why the hell are you still standing here, lady? Get out. Seriously, it reminded me of retail at Christmas. Here's a pro tip: Treat customer service people with respect and they will usually repay in kind, plus more. 

I had a great first experience and I look forward to using them again.",ZWt__3MBepCHn-lCo9sTCQ,4.0,2019-11-04 01:13:26,J1Kf61Jt346SF5CJ7wcl2g,6,2019-11-04 01:13:26

4138226,1,4,e7oUXmpNOvC7e0P8AfTdyg,"First experience here- I drove a couple hours to get here because the dispensary by me doesn't have lozenges. I called before I came and since I didn't know exactly what time I would arrive- they told me I could just do a walk in. I got here and filled out my paperwork and handed it in at 12:10. It's 12:45 and I'm still watching people that came after me walk in and out. This is definitely not the way things are handled in the dispensaries I've been to before. I asked how much longer and they told me I was next- but yet people that filled out ppwk are still going in before me. 
I was called in at 12:55- it seems that you have to have a consultation before you can purchase which I haven't experienced at other dispensaries. I wish the desk staff would have told me that - I could have planned better.",ZWt__3MBepCHn-lCo9sTCQ,4.0,2019-02-04 17:43:51,KcJq3vLhRgTBU2C14uKQgQ,1,2019-02-04 17:43:51

They have increased their selection of medicate items and the prices are competitive. BOGO thru the 31st for prior Swell patients. Also their first time patient offer in general is also just as good for brand new patients. Several locations around the valley. Kudos to Curaleaf for offering a new patient special when they rebranded for the old Swell Farmacy patients. Safe, clean, security on site.
