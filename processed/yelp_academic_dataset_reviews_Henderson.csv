42181,1,10,eg0OCOA-Q9pnjby_DBIkAQ,"About 3 months ago, we were looking for movers. I found these guys on yelp and hired them to help us move. They were very polite. The only problem is they took almost 7 hours to move a bedroom set, a bunk bed, a china cabinet and some boxes AND charged us $550 (to make 1 trip and it was less than 10 miles)!! My husband is a disabled veteran and was not able to move any of the furniture. They scratched and broke the frame of our $10,000 bed that we got brand new and was assembled in our house only 5 months before we moved. 
My husband called them a few days later when we started to notice all the scratches and dents on our bed frame and a side table that's been in my family for 15 years. They asked my husband to send pictures of the damages and he did. It's been over 3 months and still no word from these guys. I hired these guys cuz of the reviews on yelp. WTF happened??? I seriously feel like we got ripped the f*ck off! I'm really more mad about the fact that my husband tried to contact them about the damages and they never called back or even email back. Call me unreasonable but I would never hire these guys again or recommend them to anyone! Pictures of the damages are posted! ***UPDATE****
I get an email stating that my picture were REMOVED because they do not represent the business.. Really??? My funiture is damaged BECAUSE of their business. And when my husband tried to reach out to them about the damages, all they said was email us some pictures. Guess what???? HE DID!! Did they even call back? NOPE. It's been 5 months and still no callback, not even a letter. No worries. I will take it up with Channel 8 news and I'll have them investigate.

84022,0,3,2zS-JBQGUa67hNA1YLbOVA,"Pretty disappointing move. In fact, worst move I've ever been through - and I've even moved cross-country.

Two stars for showing up, almost, on time and working fairly quickly. Otherwise they did more harm than good.

Of the stack of furniture pads they brought with them, they only used one, underneath some boxes. They failed to wrap up any large pieces, and my desk was left banged up. Paint traded onto my antique trunk, and Daniel (I think?) tried to say it was they way we had it packed by our mattress in storage. OUR MATTRESS? Last I checked, we hadn't recently gotten it painted.. And the cherry on top, the freaking mattress was in plastic wrap! 99.98% sure it happened during the drive across town, especially cause we stood there watching them load up, and it was scuff-free at that time. Guys think maybe you should've used some of those furniture pads?

 When putting down our stainless steel tabletop, they scratched the hell out of a picture I had just bought. They didn't even have to lay a finger on it to screw that one up.

Now, of the two stars, they lost both of 'em when Eli promised he'd be back next-day to repair the frame. That is not the case, and he's unresponsive. I'd be amazed to see him come through. Pretty annoying though that he offered a self-done repair job. Any reputable company would offer REFRAMING COSTS.

And finally, almost the whole time Eli was playing some awful screamo music, without even running it by us first. Totally disrespectful and absolutely unprofessional, especially as the owner.

In short, I would recommended you NOT use this company.",338D7EQfInzHV8Ve1b0-eQ,1.0,2015-07-18 01:33:16,6AmQPUHvMaEbFI45UYXY8A,0,2015-07-18 01:33:16

He said he'd call me back to see what they could do and never did, this was Sunday late morning. Sunday night I wrote a 2 star review and he immediately replied that he would call me in the morning and would find time or have a referral company. Based on that I removed my review. Fast forward to today I spent most of it on the phone getting a mover. I'm now using Red Carpet on Thursday. 

I believe it is sad the power reviews can have so I rarely give a bad one but this was poor customer service and even if you can't do something just say it, don't say you'll get back to someone and never follow through.

PS the owner's response was the same he responded the day I originally wrote the review and deleted it as he was supposed to call the next morning and never did. We've now moved and he replied AFTER THE FACT to make it appear they actually cared.

When booking the move ask questions like what is your garage size, backyard furniture, etc. Not just considering square footage. I took an SUV full of stuff and there is still more stuff we have to pick up tomorrow cause the u-haul that they brought was not big enough. I did have some of my newer furniture damaged. The headboard was pretty badly damaged for my bed. Luckily I found the piece that broke off and Eli fixed it ok. Couple other things here and there like my drawers to my new dresser-the track was broken on one drawer. I can live with it I guess. The move was reasonably priced and the guys worked hard going from a one to two story house. There was a couple big items they couldn't get up the stairs but I think any mover would have a hard time with the items.",338D7EQfInzHV8Ve1b0-eQ,3.0,2014-07-13 06:33:00,NsHeN5dKRmYfJTmTxMITmQ,0,2014-07-13 06:33:00

Loss of stars due to the HORRIBLE customer service provided by the manager that I had to deal named Kyle. I was scheduled for arrival time of 2pm to 5pm. Movers were running late. Was never called. I had to call to ask where they were. Manager tried to justify the fact that they were late by saying it was only 30 minutes which was no big deal to him. I had a busy day and it was getting close to being dark outside. He argued with me instead of trying to make the situation better.

Young and enthusiastic, Kyle and Eli epitomize professionalism and I would contact them again if the need arose!  Timely, conscientious, accommodating and totally trustworthy, we felt completely at ease with them handling even our most fragile collectibles accumulated from around the globe.  Although learning their trade during time with some of the larger national companies, they felt they could do a better job themselves and I readily admit they went the ""extra mile"" (or, in our case, 1400 miles) and displayed genuine concern for our household and our memories that I can't recall from some other carriers that treated us as another work call.  They even voluntarily detoured and made a side-trip along the way to deliver some items to our son in Arizona.  All the members of their team were rock-solid and friendly ""go-getters"", and from the banter and laughter reverberating through the house, they all obviously enjoyed their work and working with each other.

After a brief hold she tells me it's her fault but it's no longer available. I asked if she's refunding the payment, she put me on hold to speak to the manager. I was on hold for about 10mins before she comes back, manager isn't available. However she won't transfer me to their voicemail or anything. She continues to apologize and state she doesn't want to get in trouble but knows this is her fault. I'm very concerned over payment taken for a service we can't even use. She tells me she still can't reach the manager after another long hold then states she'll email me confirming refund in 10mins. I get an email 15mins later from someone else in the company stating a refund would be issued.
