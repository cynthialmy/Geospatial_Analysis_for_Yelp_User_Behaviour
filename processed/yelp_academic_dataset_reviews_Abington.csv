On the door walking in there are images of the credit cards they accept but when you walk to the counter there is a hand written sign that says something to the effect of we do not accept credit cards use the ATM next door. 

I told my husband we would need to go elsewhere to eat then. At this point some guy came up to take our order, we commented on the credit card thing and he gave ranted at us for a good while about giving away money because the rate was 3.69% per sale and he cant afford to pay it and the electric and this and that. Like ok whatever dude, you're in business as is the bank you agreed to their terms and conditions when you had it installed to run your business. 

He then handed us a menu and said we could order it off of the web from foodcab.net.

At this point I was pretty much over this guys bad attitude and wanted to just walk out of there but my husband was pretty upset as he really wanted BBQ so we ordered off line from the foodcab.net since we could use our credit card. 

When we finally got the food to us it was bland and dry. even my cat turned her nose up too it. The corn bread was less like a side dish and more like a dessert.

32595,0,1,U42BpvXjJsxNEZTsDkcZhg,"I tried here. I really, really tried to give them a chance but alas, this review HAS to be updated.

Little Caesars of Roslyn, you continue to disappointed me.

I'll start with what is positive: price and location. I can walk to your store. The $5 hot and ready is SUPER convenient for me to grab on my way to a girlfriend's house. That is, when you actually have them. Twice now, there were no pizzas ""hot and ready"".

I will tell you what your number one problem is and what is holding this business back: Employees.

Every time I go in there, I see a new face. I understand that the average age may be teenager and I don't disparage that. Hey, I washed dishes at that age too. However, these children are not properly trained; especially on the phone. They have zero communication skills.

For example, I called yesterday (12/04/16) around noon for a pizza. I gave the girl my order and the conversation had come to a natural close. I said ""Ok, thank you"". *CLICK* She hung up. No ""thank you, goodbye, thanks for calling, etc"". Nothing. Just a click. It was rude. Even the Greeks that don't speak perfect English across the street say ""thank you, goodbye"". It is just common courtesy (or at least it should be).

The other indecent I had was a few months ago. I kept calling and calling to place an order and all I got was a busy signal. This went on for over 15 minutes so I figured I'll just walk over there. I tell the girl behind the counter that I've been trying to call and their line is busy. There was no one else in the store. She tells me ""Uh...we are busy"". I was immediately suspicious. ""Really?"" I ask. ""Is this your number?"" I show the number of the pizzeria saved in my phone. She confirms it. I dial and put it on speakerphone. Busy signal. ""Why isn't your landline ringing right now?"" I ask. She just smiles and asks if I would like to order. 

This tells me either they took the phone off the hook or someone else working (not working?) there was using the phone out of my sight. I didn't see anyone else but the girl behind the counter.

There was a ""Help Wanted"" sign up yesterday when I went to pick up my pizza. I agree that this place does need some serious staffing help or else they aren't going to make it. This is a shame because once you get past the lousy employees, and wait, the pizza itself is good. But with the volume of turnover, the hassle with ordering, and inconsistent pizza-ready times I'm going to have to go somewhere else in the neighborhood. Luckily in my previous review, I listed how many there are in the neighborhood so we will not be without pizza.

Good luck, L.C. on getting some new, quality, staff members in there.",UcdjvDYQg6B1Ht9FEqNKnw,2.0,2016-12-05 20:47:58,GYt3N67dTDXsMB9jSbk14Q,0,2016-12-05 20:47:58

***Update*** I received the  pad for the runner this morning, 4/14. The area rug pad was supposed to be delivered today as well. When I called the store to advise the pad was not delivered, I was told the sales rep would look into why it was not delivered and call me back; i called at about 1:15 this afternoon and as of now, 5:00, i have had no word.. I also inquired about the pro-rata refund for the part of the rug that I paid for but didn't receive. I was told, in no uncertain terms, that the order was placed for an 8x10 area not 8x11. I will be taking my paperwork to the store so this sales rep can see for herself that she did order an 8x11 rug and that she did NOT order an 8x10 rug. I do not appreciate being told I am wrong, or a liar, when I know i am correct and the sales rep is wrong. 
It is frustrating that the cheapest items in my order are the ones giving me the headaches. 
May , 3, 2017 update:
I did visit the store in April to show the sales rep-Abby- that she indeed ordered an 8x11 area rug as evidenced by every single set of order papers I have. She insisted that the rug was ordered correctly as 8x10...repeatedly telling me i did not understand. Seeing that no further headway was possible with Abby regarding the misleading and false info on my paperwork I then inquired about the missing area rug pad. She said she finally got an answer from their warehouse in response to her email. Apparently the pad had been lost AGAIN. 
Imagine my surprise when we installed the runner pad and it was two full feel SHORT. . When I went to the store about the very short pad i was told abby would order it and call me the following Saturday to confirm it was ordered. No surprise here, she never called to confirm that order.
I waited a full week for her to call. Finally I emailed their ""comfort care"" email address detailing my list of problems with my order. Lindsey emailed me back, apologizing for the hassles I have had with this order, and offered to refund the cost of the arm/headrest ""napkins"" at $111.30 for the inconveniences. So far so good then Lindsey advised that she could not handle rug/ pad issues. I called first and spoke to Chuck about my frustrations most notably that his sales woman sold us something that does not exist and that I wanted a 9% refund on the area rug, totaling $57.24. They are ordering a new larger runner pad at no cost to me. 
Very long incomplete story short, they are refusing to refund 9% of the sales price for the missing foot of area rug and I still don't have the proper size runner pad nor the area rug pad. I am very dissatisfied with their ""customer service"" at the store level. If i could i would give them ZERO STARS. It's a shame because I really like my furniture. Dallas the store manager has NO interest in seeing us satisfied all over $57.24and seems he can ignore corporate directives at will. All I can say is-double/triple/quadruple check your order before paying one cent, don't believe any of the info in writing and question everything the sales rep tells you.",JTM0CtxIIV8B9IEN8t4Plg,1.0,2017-05-04 03:59:29,TdW8ZuBtmBz4f8WULvbNsA,0,2017-05-04 03:59:29

Half the food was out (no chicken, no peppers, no fruit, etc etc) and nobody was making more. They were mostly just standing around while two girls unenthusiastically worked the line. 

And those two girls put together the most slapdashed burrito I've ever seen, falling apart before it was even rolled in the foil (which also fell apart because even the foil was poorly folded).

The store personnel didn't seem to think I needed to be told that (1) my order was in; and (2) that payment needed to be made in full before they could even schedule delivery of my furniture. I had to call them to find out where my order was and ask if it was available for delivery. 
When the delivery was initially scheduled , the rug pads for my rug and runner were not available. When I got the call to let me know what time frame to expect the delivery, i was told both pads were in and would be delivered. The morning of the delivery, I got a call from their warehouse that only one pad would be delivered as the other was lost. And when the furniture was delivered there were NO RUG PADS AT ALL. Their warehouse managed to lose BOTH pads. And the rug we ordered was a full foot shorter than what we ordered. We ordered an  8x11 rug; we received an 8x10 rug. The designer who came out to our house brought us the manufacturer spec sheet that shows the rug at 8x10 and the store spec sheet showing the rug measurement of 8x11...apparently the dimension was entered incorrectly at the corporate level. I have requested a pro-rated refund, of about 9%, as I did not get the rug I ordered and paid for-I got a rug a full foot shorter than my order. I have heard nothing yet about that   
One  of my chairs has a squeak, that is getting worse by the day and won't be repaired for another two weeks. 
The store refunded the delivery charge in a timely manner for the inconvenience of the missing rug pads.; that was last Wednesday.I did receive a voicemail from the designer on Monday, and I was not able to call the until today. The voicemail said nothing about the pads being found.
The delivery people were great, very careful, polite, and quick. I am very disappointed with the store people and their lack of timely repair services and communications. 
***Update*** I received the  pad for the runner this morning, 4/14. The area rug pad was supposed to be delivered today as well. When I called the store to advise the pad was not delivered, I was told the sales rep would look into why it was not delivered and call me back; i called at about 1:15 this afternoon and as of now, 5:00, i have had no word.. I also inquired about the pro-rata refund for the part of the rug that I paid for but didn't receive. I was told, in no uncertain terms, that the order was placed for an 8x10 area not 8x11. I will be taking my paperwork to the store so this sales rep can see for herself that she did order an 8x11 rug and that she did NOT order an 8x10 rug. I do not appreciate being told I am wrong, or a liar, when I know i am correct and the sales rep is wrong.

I arrived the next morning and was checked in by the staff who confirmed the appointment went over the costs and additional suggested add ons and sent me on my way.

A couple hours later I came back and looked in the window to see that my car was in the air with all four wheels off.  I assumed it was going to take longer so I went home.  On the way home THREE AND A HALF HOURS later I received a phone call that there was ""some kind of mistake"" and my tires wouldn't be available for another 4 days??  I asked why the system showed them in stock and they apologized but implied that I must have made an error because the tires aren't available.  

When I returned to pick up my car, the man at the counter was very apologetic but still tried to explain that it was my error.  There was no attempt to make amends, no offer to try and rush tires in, no discount for future service, no suggestion for different tire swap and NO explanation for why it took nearly 4 hours for someone to realize my tires weren't in stock?  

As I was leaving I went to the website and went online and found that there were several other snow tires listed as ""in stock"" ready to be mounted, I called and pointed it out to the store and they simply said ""sorry, the site is wrong, none of them will be in four 4 days either.""  Obviously, if the site was still showing tires in stock that were unavailable it was their error and not mine, they still offered no solution of any kind.

My biggest complaint about this location is how they speak over the phone. Twice I have called and the girl whom answered was difficult to understand. She runs her words together and I kept having to ask ""what?"" I also believe that the phone line is bad as it sounds like static.

The pizza is as good as I remember it in High School. Little Caesars was a favorite in our home growing up and the Crazy Bread brings back memories. Until last night, I have never tried their wings and I LOVED the garlic parmesan.

They don't have a printed menu yet, just an orange flyer. This is disappointing because it does not list all of their wing sauces or their famous dips. 

Speaking of dips, when I called last night to order- I asked about what kind of dips they have. Remember- they don't have a proper menu yet so I had no way of knowing. The girl's response was ""we have a lot"". Okay......that doesn't help because I wanted to know what specifically they had. She said I can choose one when I come in. Unknown to her, I wasn't picking up the pizza order myself but sending my guy instead. Now I was leaving a lot to chance and it was in his hands to choose a proper dipper. I didn't feel like explaining this to her and just said ""fine"". (He did ok and came back with Buffalo Ranch).

I did have to ask her a few times to repeat herself as she talked very quickly and seemed to want to get off the phone. She kept asking ""is that all?"" to each item I ordered. ""One large cheese pizza. Ok, is that all?"" Why yes, I want Crazy Bread too. ""One large pizza and one order of crazy bread. Is that all?"" Yes, I also want wings, and dips. If you give me a second- I will tell you my entire order.

So there is room for improvement here but I would like to say ""Welcome to the Neighborhood Little Caesars!""

It took 3 hours to do what I was told would take 1 hour. The shop was not crowded.

While I was there, 2 guys waited over an hour for an oil change and there was no one in front of them. On one of the oil changes the cap was not put on and the hood not locked. The hood flew up with oil spurting everywhere.

2 of us came for tires. One ordered in person days before only to discover the wrong size was ordered.

I was told one set of tires when I called, and they put on a completely different set saying they got the size wrong on the phone. They did not ask, nor tell me this happened, I had to point this out. I likely would have gone somewhere else had the truth been told to me on the phone. Only after I pointed out what was going on did they reduce the cost of the tires.

So as far as Thai Cuisine & Cafe, It was OK, but nothing to write home about. I tried the tom yom soup and the padthai with veggies. The tom yom seemed like the kind of soup you can buy at the store in a can....except they added chicken. I was pretty disappointed in the soup overall- it lacked the lemongrass flavor and spiciness and was pretty watery. My entree earned them a little redemption, but overall the tofu was shriveled and overcooked, and the noodles lacked the full flavor I am accustomed to tasting with pad thai. A bite of green curry from my friend seemed especially salty as well. 

As for the pros- they have clearly established a nice place, and the cozy decor was cute. We came with a party of 13, so it was nice of them to accommodate us in their small restaurant.

I gave them the make and model of the car and was given a price of $190. I then brought the car back and had a tune up. They quoted me a price of $755 for the tune up and I asked about installing motor mounts. Kevin said yes no problem it will be the $190 I quoted you. I said ok to do both tune up and install both motor mounts. They called and said all the work was completed come pick up the car. We got there and paid them $997 for tune up and to install the motor mounts. I then get a call the next morning that they never installed the motor mounts even though I was charged for it. James then asked if I can drop the car off ASAP so they can install the motor mounts. My wife left work early to drop the car off then had to walk a mile or so home in the cold. I then get a call at 6:30 in the evening saying they can't install motor mounts because they would have to take out the entire engine to do so and they don't have the equipment to do so. They said we will refund you the $190. Total amateur operation. Talked to my nephew who is a mechanic and he told me they were full of crap and wouldn't need to remove engine.

7 Rolls of film later I called up Larmon in hopes of having it transferred digitally with care, quality, and professionalism.

I was thrilled when I was told it would be completed same day. I work in the film/video industry and I'm constantly traveling. I also write a detailed behind the scenes blog about my work and travels so to have someone do the scanning for the photos for me while my Canon 5DMII was broken sounded AMAZING. ...turns out it was going to take at least an entire week. WOW...I mean I was understanding, but at the cost of $147.00 to transfer for an entire week? No thanks.

I also found out that they were burning the transfer for CD, which was going to be an additional cost of $4.99 PER DISC! To put this into a cost perceptive They scanned only 2 rolls of film that burned those 2 rolls of film onto THIRTEEN CDs! I have a new Macbook Pro which doesn't have a disc drive...so that's useless to me. I was bringing in a flash drive to drop off WHEN....

I walked in the next day to pick up part of my order and the two employees were outwardly complaining about my order because it was so time consuming. I was so taken aback that I left the store and sat out in the car to think things over. Very long day and story short they stole $100.00 from me instead of giving me a full refund which is what I should have demanded.

I'll be reporting them to the Better Business Bureau for their lack of professionalism and blatant theft.

The man who took care of me was older and I felt like he treated me like a child. I'm 26...which isn't old to many of you, but in the past I worked in a professional photo retail store for 3 years while I was in college and if I acted like he or his coworker had when I had when I walked into the store, I know for a fact that I would have been fired.

It's no wonder why there is only one of these photo stores left in business left open if this is how they treat customers. I'm not a new customer either.

Everyone knows about bats. They're the creatures that hang out in the haunted houses.  They're the companion to the pumpkin and witch on the Halloween drawings your kid brings home from school.  Superheroes are sometimes modeled after them.  

They also sometimes wind up in your basement, sleeping in a corner, waiting to surprise you when you go downstairs to put some laundry in the washer. 

Admittedly, I wasn't even sure what it was at first.  I just know it wasn't supposed to be there, and it moved ever so slightly.  I called my husband downstairs to see what he thought.  Never heard a human being screech that loud, at least not in person.  Once we determined it was, in fact, a bat, we were tasked with finding someone to remove said bat, on a Wednesday evening, from our home.  Also adding to the fun is the 5-month-old baby in the house.  We thought he may be too young for pets.

Pest control services don't really have much of a presence on Yelp, which is really too bad, because in my experience, when you have a real problem, it's good to have the best help.  Upon looking in the Yellow Pages (yes, that still exists, and yes, we use it), I called numerous pest control services.  Mr. Willard of Willard Pest Control was, by far, the nicest one I spoke with on the phone.  In fact, he made me laugh.  Hard to do when there's a bat hanging out downstairs.  He said he would come over within an hour, and he was there within 30 minutes.  He was able to get the bat and humanely brought it outside and set it free.  He then spent time talking with us about bats (they're completely random and you can't prevent them, other than securing holes) and other pests; all the while, making us laugh and almost forget that we had just interrupted our normal Wednesday night for BAT REMOVAL.  

He owns and operates his company and has been in business for 33 years.  While he was with us, he answered his phone anytime it rang and helped customers/potential customers right away.  He was so great and diligent that we decided to hire him to do our general extermination every three months.  I feel safe and secure knowing that Mr. Willard will be handling our pest control from now on!  

His prices are extremely reasonable and he is very fair and knowledgable.  Perhaps you will never experience a bat in your house (lucky you), but if you are in the market for an exterminator, I highly recommend Mr. Willard!",5BJVmYyAY87tWTRhv1Vfog,5.0,2013-08-22 13:16:08,Gonq8DOHTm_1uoKuG_pvJg,1,2013-08-22 13:16:08

Well we noticed that this place was here so I checked the reviews on Yelp and was almost dissuaded from giving the place a shot but we went anyway.

This is just the newish higher standard of fast food applied to (pseudo) Mexican; the Shake Shack of Mexican if you will.

When you show up you line up and the guy working the line asks what you want - several protein choices, pintos or black beans, brown or white rice, avocado if you want for 2 bucks more etc...

I took hot salsa and the line guy a young, gregarious black fellow opined that they had little call for hot salsa.  I replied that we were in a very white area and they might do well if they offered mayo.  The lineman seemed to find the comment to be rather amusing but quickly snapped back to corporate script mode.

The food was fine, but I have been eating burritos for years.  Have I had worse?  Yeah.  Have I had better?  Well that depends - some je ne se quoi is missing, but the ingredients are all fresh and good and the food is very good - just not what one might get on 5th street or in Kennett Square.

Service was uniformly fine, fast and polite.  The place is nicely set up very clean, comfortable and has great music from a good sound system.

They replaced a valve stem and said the light would go out. It didn't. They also claimed the front axle needed to be fixed or the car could have a serious accident. Fortunately I didn't pay to have that repair done.

When the tire pressure warning light did not go out by the next day, I went back. This time I was told the battery in the sensor was the problem. I left and went immediately to Subaru for a second opinion. After inspecting the car, the Subaru mechanic told me the tire pressure in all four tires was at 70 psi instead of the recommended 30/32. The Subaru mechanic removed the excess air from the tires. He also examined the axle and determined there was absolutely nothing wrong with it.

I called the manager at Mavis and explained the situation. He insisted Mavis did not fill the tire to 70 and did nothing wrong.

To make a long story short, the repairman told me I needed to replace a part of my dishwasher and that it would be cheaper to buy a new one. Okay fine. I bought a new dishwasher and the men who installed the dishwasher told me it was a simple clamp issue that could have been fixed and that I wouldn't have needed a whole new motor/ dishwasher. Keep in mind, I know nothing about dishwashers, hence why I have repairmen coming to my house. When I called Reed's simply to question the whole situation (was it the clamp? motor? both? The dishwasher itself?) the woman on the phone was terribly defensive. She acted outraged that I could possibly have any misunderstandings about pieces of a dishwasher and what a clamp/ motor was. I told her I was just going by what the dishwasher installation specialist told me (they made it seem to me that it was a simple adjustment of a clamp.) Again in a very annoyed tone, she explained what the repairman meant by clamp/ motor. By this point in the conversation I was going to say that I understood what she was saying and out of curiosity I asked what the average size of a motor is and she barked  ""it doesn't matter what size it is!!!"" in a very angry and insulting tone.

 I ordered the egg sandwich on a pretzel because that sounded good to me! From that description i was expecting the egg and cheese to be on a soft pretzel... It was on a pretzel roll. Not bad--actually delicious--but not what I expected. Their hash browns were the gross shredded ones and not actual potatoes.

My wife had the Tex-Mex breakfast because that's right up her alley.... The description says ""Fresh warm crisp tortillas topped with scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese, onions, beans, tomatoes, cilantro, green peppers and fresh jalapeños, served with sour cream and guacamole, finished with ranchero sauce"" which we figured would be full sized tortillas, right? It was basically breakfast nachos. Good, but again not what we expected.

Our waitress looked bored-borderline annoyed at our presence. Only came over when required--no check in with us, didn't ask if I wanted more coffee (I did want more).

Teh modern look, the cool indoor waterfall, the indoor/outdoor space was great! Since the change (many years ago) their parking lot is hardly ever empty and I've always enjoyed an adequate meal. Not amazing, but pretty good. Yes, the prices are high for the area, but I never minded because it was consistent.

Then, this morning happened.

I was in search of breakfast, and remembered their ""breakfast specials starting at 8:00 A.M"" sign. I was seated at a table which was filled with crumbs. I moved. I was given a menu which was sticky, dirty, and had no ""breakfast special"" on it. When I asked the bored, overly-perfumed server, her answer was, ""this is what we have"" and pointed to the menu. She asked me for my order. I ordered poached eggs and decaf. I finished my decaf a full 5 minutes before my meal came. I was offered regular, and had to stop the server before she poured it in my cup. 

My meal arrived with cold toast, watered-down (I'm not kidding) poached eggs in a coffee cup, and another offer of regular coffee refill.

I won't even get started on my companion's meal. Not much better.

I had to call the server over to tell her. She responded with an appropriate ""I'll get you something else."" I then got scrambled with the bottom piece of toast burnt. At least I saved myself some carbs!

I went to the restroom. It was like following Hansel and Gretel's route because of all the crumbs on the floor. And, the filth of the floor as though it hadn't been swept or cleaned in years. The bathroom was somewhat clean, but at that point I could hardly picture what the kitchen looked like. 

And, I noticed the waterfall was not working.

Instead of an apology, I noticed my companion was charged for a cup of coffee. He didn't have coffee.

The jerk chicken and jerk shrimp are both awesome (but still spicy if you choose mild, so be careful!). The mac and cheese is the best I've ever had.

My boss's surprise birthday party was held here, and the staff did an excellent job accommodating our pre-arranged group of about 14 people (including two kids).  My boss's wife, who organized the shindig, had dropped off some wine and champagne the day before, and when I arrived (appropriately 15 minutes early, seeing as it was a surprise), the staff had already opened a few of the white, arranged the champagne so it was at the ready, and had the red on a nearby table (also serving as the gift table) - and they had obviously kept the white wine & champagne in the fridge overnight, which should seem like an obvious move, but I think it exemplifies great customer service.

We were offered soup or salad to start, followed by the main event, which had been pre-ordered: a huge sushi boat, a platter of basic rolls, and two plates each of chicken teriyaki and vegetable tempura.  About halfway through, we decided to order some more items - still hungry, plus we had more vegetarians in the group than expected.  Second round included a few fancy rolls, more veggie tempura, and spicy edamame - which, if you're interested, was a heap of some kind of chili sauce on top of regular edamame; not all that spicy at first bite, but the more you ate, the more you felt it, and it was surprisingly good.  
All of the sushi was excellent. 

Boss's wife had also dropped off dessert the day before - cake and some mini eclairs.  Before they brought it out, the waitresses dimmed the lights, then carried out the cake with candles ablaze.  I thought the light dimming was a sweet touch - it made for an even more dramatic entrance for the dessert!

We stayed for over 3 hours and were the last ones in the joint - we never felt rushed to leave and got nothing but smiles and thank you's from the staff.  I highly recommend this place for a small party or just a nice dinner out in the 'burbs.",AcvTfzjZ7Kw42HF5ew-Bpg,5.0,2013-08-04 04:41:16,gqimocAPnvr9V-YjYhfElg,3,2013-08-04 04:41:16

Also for an appetizer, we ordered the Beef Negimaki. This was amazing. A great teriyaki sauce with sesame...I would have licked the remaining sauce on the plate (instead we put some rice on it) it was so good.

I had the Spicy Pork  for dinner which looked dry but it was just the opposite. Tender, well seasoned pork, with just the right amount of heat.

Hubby had some sashimi and a roll of some type ( I'm not that into sushi) but he loved them and ordered some to go so he could have it later.

Only reason why put 2-stars is its generous portion. Other than that, sushi itself was really below average and sushi figures were not ""in shape"" for my standard. Cut size was too thick for sushi - but one can say it is generous amount. For me, sushi is ""balance"" among its shape, amount of rice, taste of rice, freshness or distinctive taste of fish. If one item is too much, it is no longer sushi for me. Tuna, Hamachi, Salmon, Saba...all came out with ""generous"" thick cut...but rice was too weak and not balanced well. I felt like ""Fish piece on top of small ball of rice""; rice was also too sweet for sushi for me. I prefer a little more vinegar flavor than sugar taste.

He followed up with the Margarita Beef Steak served with two black bean enchiladas. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and seasoned nicely. The enchiladas were packed full of beans, he could only finish one. He enjoyed everything very much.

I started with the Ahi Tuna Steak which was grilled and served on top of seaweed salad and cusabi sauce. I'm not exactly sure what cusabi sauce is (cucumber wasabi?) but it was DELICOUS with great hints of ginger. The tuna was cooked perfectly and was really tender and flavorful. There were also crispy wontons on top which added a great crunch. Very delicious. For dinner I had the grilled fish tacos (I love my seafood in the summer!) which were topped with pickled cabbage and lemon aioli. The lemon aioli was great with the fish. I think there was a little bay and cucumber salt mixed in and it was a great accent. The fish was tender and flaky.

For dessert we split T's Restaurant Week cheesecake. It was a bit of a thin slice which was disappointing since it was so creamy and tasty. I hate when cheesecake is dry and this did not disappoint. It was served with fresh berries and a caramel drizzle. Yum.

We will definitely be going back. There were several menu items we wanted to try and two desserts (the banana caramel xango and fried oreos a la mode) calling my name. Our server was friendly and the girly drinks the table next to us ordered looked fab. I'm not sure why this place gets such mediocre reviews. I hope we never find out ...",JmzNw0WCPmZPZdq5nx9brg,4.0,2012-06-29 14:03:17,pzyKIwEUp8axXqlRCUUfqg,0,2012-06-29 14:03:17

The spinach and artichoke was pretty standard but the nachos were huge.  The plate came out with a mound of cheese, peppers, olives with sides of salsa, guac and sour cream.  I ordered it for myself but it easily fed the three of us with more than 1/2 left over when we were done.

Our server Andre was very friendly and attentive.  We never needed/wanted for anything because he checked in frequently.

After we finished our apps we decided to move to the bar area for a couple more drinks and to listen to the music.  I forgot to mention-there is a dj on Friday and Saturday nights.  The bar area service was basically non existent. We waited at the bar table for 20 minutes and didn't get greeted or offered a drink menu. I saw who I thought was the manager walk by and said excuse me, we made eye contact and he kept walking.  Every table around us was served.  After waiting for so long we decided to leave and on the way out I saw the manager and took my chance.  Without speaking to the server he said the server thought we didn't want anything because we just had dinner.  When I asked why he ignored me he said he thought I was saying hi ‍.

It was myself, my husband, and our 4 young children. My youngest is 14 months old. Babies have no patience. She didn't offer bread, which I saw on other people's tables, I had to ask for it. Obviously bread would help calm down my 14 month old while we wait on our slow waitress. 
We ordered for the kids first. She totally DOES NOT put my son's order in for cheeseburger and fries. So we just said forget it and take it off the bill. HOW DO YOU FORGET A WHOLE MEAL!?! ‍

I noticed the Cheese Steak Omelet on the menu which intrigued me, so I gave it a try. It was really good, the egg and cheese steak both well cooked.

There wasn't anything added to them and they were barely crusted, they can definitely do better. 

My wife had a craving for a BLT with a slice of avocado and cheese ... obviously that is not something normally on the menu, however they did their best to accommodate her.

I recently moved to Levittown, Pennsylvania after graduating college and found a great Trini spot in Hamilton, New Jersey about 20 minutes from my house where I can get some great, cheap, authentic Trinidadian eats. Then, I moved to Warrington, Pennsylvania, and began to crave some good Trinidadian food! I did a search on the Internet for places nearby and this came up. Upon entering the place and looking at the menu, I could tell that the food was primarily Jamaican despite the owners being Trinidadian. That was no problem for me because I love Jamaican food as well. The food was very tasty: I got a fish sandwich as well as a curried shrimp platter with rice and beans and cabbage. My total came out to almost $26. The food was pretty decent. However, it was extremely, extremely pricey. The shrimp platter in itself was $15, and most of the other platters on their menu range from $14 to $16. (The fish sandwich was  $7.) Coming from Queens, and also having traveled around Brooklyn as well, I knew that this price was outrageous. I've gotten similar platters for $9, $10 max in NYC. Maybe even $12, but nowhere near $15.

It isn't too far from my grandmother's home and it had a nice diverse menu with a decent downtown ambience for a place in the county. But, my recent experience there has completely turned me off, I am no longer sure I can support them as much anymore. 

My family wanted to celebrate a great accomplishment in my life and I decided to go to the Kitchen Bar, on a Sunday. Everything about the place seems to be the same but the food was horrible. We ordered a number of appetizers and the only ones that were good were the mussels and hot wings. The salad was decent but very short on the feta. I personally had the tuna steak and asked for it medium RARE and it came out well done. I didn't understand how that could occur and neither could the waitress, she seem to not be familiar what medium rare meant. 

After the lunch, I asked everyone what they thought of their meals and they said it was ""lousy."" I'm not sure if it was because it was a Sunday or what but I really was disappointed the Kitchen Bar had dropped so much in quality. I think I am going to give them some time off.

801287,4,3,5hxemkHK-bLb8eFi6_ugwQ,"As a native New Yorker, I have strong feelings about Chinese food, pizza, and bagels. Now that I live outside Philly, it may be unfair to measure local forms of this holy edible trinity against the New York gold standard. But I do anyway because what is life but an awkward pas de deux between high hopes and crushing heartache?

Then I discovered AASB. It's a modest little place, reminiscent of the bagel joints of my glorious geographic past. Also, easy to miss when whizzing down Old York Road at 90 miles per hour.

Over the course of four visits, I have found the bagels at AASB to be consistently fresh and exquisite. They give me little mouthgasms when I sink my teeth into them. 

My girlfriend enjoys the bagels here, too, but doesn't get as worked up about them. Just today I asked, ""Hey, honey, you enjoying that bagel?""

""Yeah it's good but...you know, keep in mind that it's just a bagel.""

One time the bagel-tender asked if I wanted my bagel toasted. I threw my head back and laughed uproariously. ""In New York, it's a crime against nature to toast a fresh bagel!"" I explained, wiping tears from my eyes and spittle from my beard.

""Ah!"" said the bagel-slinger (who I assume was the owner). ""Glad to meet a true connoisseur who appreciates the fact that I come to work 5:30 every morning to make these babies fresh!""

See, toasting a fresh bagel is like ordering filet mignon well-done. (P.S. I'm sorry if I hurt the feelings of any bagel toasters out there, but you're doing it wrong.)

I don't see the quintessential bagel-and-lox pairing on the menu board, but AASB offers a variety of cream cheese blends and breakfast-type sandwiches on bagels. Certain sandwich combos are listed as staff favorites, like you might find in a neighborhood book shop or a Blockbuster come back from the dead to haunt your dreams. 

Creature of habit that I am, I always order the same thing: cream cheese or lox spread on a sesame with tomato and onion. The bagels are chewy, dense, and delicious. Firm yet yielding. They taste like home and comfort and mouthfuls of happiness. 

The only downside is how quickly they go down and the fleeting nature of joy. When the bagel is gone, I am left all alone in the world with the cold horror of my own thoughts.",-ka45SR1nuoxUU4eTamE_w,5.0,2018-04-07 22:31:30,OMfTmE9S8lWbZ8fIdPpb1g,2,2018-04-07 22:31:30

Bars are known for slapping food together and serving it up to you on dirty plates and you won't care because you're drunk. That's the Kitchen bar. 

I've been to the KB 5 times altogether and it was nice only one time. 
The drinks suck. The Long Island is served in a shot glass. A real long island should sit you on your butt after ONE. I had 3 and it wasn't tipsy. 

I went for Brunch and had the Steak and Eggs. 
The steak was rubber. I felt like I could taste the freezer burn. Horrible. The Bloody Mary was awful. They pour it out of a bottle pre-made. 
No. 


The French toast was some of the worst crap I've ever tasted. I swear it was out of a box. 

Never going back here.  Marco Polo is closer and MUCH better at drinks. Better atmosphere and the meat isn't frozen Smeg.",JmzNw0WCPmZPZdq5nx9brg,1.0,2017-10-28 16:17:45,1cfl2GIaTDJ_uiiIC_kUvQ,0,2017-10-28 16:17:45

I sampled a lot of things because I like to try one thing at a time to choose my favorites and stick to it, I never came to the table with something the same because none of it was tasty.  The rice was probably the best part and that was because there was so little flavor there was no way it could be bad.  The sushi was horrible.  The sauces were left out for so long a thick film formed over top.  The cold shrimp was okay.  The pigs in a blanket were okay, but that's all I can say.  everything else was pretty horrible.  The decor was nice, aside from the posters, but being it's new that's understandable I guess.  But I came for the food and that was the worst part of the experience.  I also wasn't too thrilled with my waitress.  I left her an average tip (I didn't have any refills and she took forever to take away my plates left in the middle of the table to be taken away - this wuold be understandable if the place was busy but there were only 3 (including my party) small groups there) and she waited at the table for me to write it all out, opened the receipt book, looked at what I left for tip, made a face - did the same for the people I was with and then walked away and started talkign to her coworker with a tone in her voice.  We left, and she didn't say have a nice day or anything, she just stared.   
And in agreement, all the food was cold, but  it's because the pans were so shallow it could only heat the bottom half of the food and not the whole thing, so if you go there maybe if you go for the food at the bottom of the pan you'll at least not have cold food!

I've been here before and thought I recalled a decent experience, well this trip proved my memory wrong ( or that times have changed) Decor was well thought out, nice place but is getting rough around the edges, time for a little updates ( the restroom smelled a bit, looked dingy and the funky decor ( lights in the floor) have seen better days.

I got the Italian hoagie Panini,  I mean how hard is that. It came with choice of soup, I took french onion which was passable, not too salty and loaded with cheese.

So what is a panini at kitchen bar? A warmed up naan with slices of so very salty deli ham ( the cheap kind) stacked on top of each other, a few pieces of pepperoni and s bit of mozzarella cheese, and a crispy chicken finger sliced (yes sliced) thin that;s it. It was bad, really bad, I did not even eat half of it ( a very rare event for me) total waste of calories for the tasteless mess that was food... 

Even the fries were horrible and how does one do that? Use fries made of chopped and pressed potato pieces formed into fry shapes instead of natural cut potatoes. 

My companion had the peach caprese salad, it is peach season so one would expect some nice fresh peach slices on it, but no, There were a few mounds of gelatinous yellow blobs on the plate, which one might think could have been peaches in another life (or on another planet) but  were likely canned peaches of the cheapest (not natural) style. Add to that some flakes of what may have been dried dusty mozzarella (or chips of paint from the flaking walls.

I think I would like to retry this place in the spring for the outside area. I've heard many good things about Kitchen Bar and I've known quite a few people that have previously worked here who have all said great things too. So when it was brought up that we should go here I was all game. Ehh.

There were five of us in my party. My sister and dad ordered a cup of the chicken noodle and I ordered the cream of crab soup. Within ten minutes my waitress brought over my soup. It wasn't until then she decided to tell us they were out of chicken noodle. My sister and my Dad opted for the french onion soup which they both said was good. The cream of crab wasn't very good, sadly. It had a lot of onions in it for whatever reason which ended up just overwhelming it. 

I will say when all of our entrees came out they were well presented. I can definitely appreciate a chef who takes the time to arrange and decorate a plate. For my entree I chose the sausage and pepper flatbread. It consisted of mozzarella, onions (A LOT), sausage, and fresh spinach on top. Did you notice how I didn't say peppers? The sausage and pepper flatbread had no peppers at all! How you manage to forget to put a main ingredient in a meal that has peppers in the title is beyond me. However, it wasn't a huge ordeal because the blend of everything else was fine. I would have appreciated a little less onions though. 

Lastly, I appreciate when my waitress cracks a smile from time to time. Or at least acts like they want to be there! Nothing. No personality, no facial expression.

I will never go back to this place, and I will have no problem sharing this experience with anyone I can. I'm wondering if other people who gave this place a less-than-stellar review (which is the majority of the reviews) have received similar messages from Carl W., or anyone else? 

I didn't love Kitchen Bar the one time I was there, but I didn't loathe it. Apparently Carl W. thought it necessary to tell me, ""when you shit on a place you are essentially putting jobs of other human beings at risk."" I don't think reviews are meant to be death sentences - they should simply be viewed as opportunities for business owners to look at for possible areas of improvement.  

Yelp reviews reflect a personal experience with a business, which is why it works. I hope harassment like this doesn't discourage people from sharing their honest opinions.

I also had the cabbage and it was crunchy (which means it still had some nutritional benefits) but I like my cabbage cooked all the way down to a soft texture, that's just my preference. I also got a side of oxtails. They had a nice flavor but I got like five bones for a $8 side. I do understand that it was a side but $8 was much to pay for the little I received. I didn't have a issue with the price just the amount I received for the price. And yes I understand that oxtails are expensive, the cost still didn't add up. Everything else is reasonably priced.  

I went on a very busy Saturday night a few weeks ago and the counter was a bit disorganized. The young lady working the counter was  overwhelmed but she was friendly and doing her best. Key note: There was a lady who saw how busy the girl was a walked up to the counter jokingly and said I guess I'll start working. I'm all for banter but with a line full of customers it wasn't the time to be joking like that. People were walking in to pick up phone orders and placing counter orders and the lady who came to help out was taking her sweet time. It was excruciating to watch because the place was becoming more packed and they only had one person working as a order taker and cashier.

The ugly mound of pasta had soaked up all the broth (what ever it was) & it was tasteless & certainly not what I had expected.
I complained to the manager partly because the menu noted penne pasta but not a thin pasta that is entirely the wrong starch for this meal not that it needs one but mostly because it looked totally unappetizing. He took my plate away & I was eventually brought a plate with penne pasta & the rest of what ever was hidden by the other pasta.

Our server basically ""grunted"" every time we spoke to her and she showed her dismay every time she had to fill our glasses with water. With me working in customer service and my sister being a server herself, we were truly disheartened by the way this employee acted. She just honestly seemed annoyed that she was there.. like why work as a waitress then?

When I go out anywhere, I expect to be treated kindly and professionally. This waitress ""Julia/Julie"" was honestly a nightmare. Which is a damn shame, bc we absolutely LOVED the food. 

Her resting bitch face made it quite uncomfortable to have fun though. And then to top off the night. When ""Julie"" came back with the receipt, we had a question bc we believed there was an indiscretion. This woman continued to speak DISRESPECTFULLY to me and went on to say ""That charge is just known"" like excuse me? But I believe it's YOUR job to let me know when something so random or small will be an additional couple dollars. And she went on to explain ""you should know that. 

THIS WOMAN LITERALLY SCOFFED AND SNORTED. It was THEE most uncomfortable situation ever. As I was walking out I looked for some type of manager. But I didn't want to make a big deal. I managed to let the hostess know of my night. She apologized. But I felt that Kitchen Bar should know of their disrespectful employees making their customers feel uncomfortable and/or unwelcome. 

And I'm aware I may sound cheap, which I SWEAR I am not. I still left this horrible woman a decent tip. Because like I explained, my sister works as a server. Again, the food was really good, and the restaurant offers delicious healthier alternatives to original diner food. But this server, like I'm not a vengeful person.. but I can say this, this woman managed to make my 10 year old brother feel uncomfortable with her attitude.

The burgers are juicy and delicious, sandwiches are good, and salads taste fresh. For dinner, the bourbon chicken is delicious! The portions are large, and flavors are on point. 

There are good light and gluten free options, such as a burger with grilled veggies instead of a bun -- and the veggies are fantastic: grilled just enough that they're soft and warm, probably the most stand-out part for me as it's a twist on the usual burger! The bourbon chicken can also be ordered gluten free.

For drinks, I'd recommend the red sangria. There's happy hour specials, too!

The atmosphere is lively. Kitchen Bar a good place to go out to eat with friends, although it can get a little bit loud, especially on the weekends when there is music playing. There may be a bit of a wait on weekends, but the hostess is usually up-front about how long it will be.

Be careful, they come out often with a nuclear hot temperature (not spicy).  French onion soup and salads are really good too.  They have a very nice outdoor sitting area which is great during a warm night.  Nicely designated areas between food and bar (high tables).  Spacier and better table arrangement then sister restaurant Drake Tavern.  

The parking is ok, but not adequate for the restaurant.  After hours, you can park down a back alley at the bank which holds maybe 6 cars.  The entrance is not really accessible to people with who have a hard time walking (climbing inclines).  If you park in one of the lot areas, you need to walk all the way around to the other side of the restaurant (up a incline where cars coming around blind curve then one to the door).  There is another entrance to this side of the restaurant, but it is alway locked for some reason. 

 I'm not sure why, but there is a sill to the ladies room door which I trip over every time (yeah, I know).  Bathroom could be kept cleaner.",JmzNw0WCPmZPZdq5nx9brg,4.0,2011-02-21 01:32:55,ZaDO7VuGWhNFd52aWmZovQ,0,2011-02-21 01:32:55

Before I throw this place under the bus, let me be clear, our server was a sweetheart and my experience was only due to horrible management and food. First soup came out cold. I thought I'll give it another try and hopefully entrees are better. Took over an hour to bring out a small pizza. It arrived under-cooked and tasted like gas station pizza..ughhhh.  I love pretty much most pizza, so the fact that I could not have more than a bite is saying something. 

They use the cheapest and most horrible tasting ingredients.  Told the server to send it back. He knew I was disgusted. Normally they would offer something to fix it, or a manager would come over, but nada.  I asked to speak to the manager whose name was Ali I believe. What a jerk off this guy was. Non apologetic, arrogant, argumentative and told me if I didn't like it, send it back (which I had already done).  Sounded more like a prison warden then a manger of a restaurant. I should have read the reviews before going here to save me the aggravation. It's ok because I now know what bad service and food is.  I will never go back or recommend this dump to anyone.

I told them I bought a set of tires from them 15 months ago ($850!) and they have 20,000 miles on them (rates for 75k).

I told them to stop doing anything immediately and I picked up the car with having an oil change done only.

I'm reading though a lot of these reviews and though most are complimentary the negative ones I nor anyone I've spoken to who have visited this location would agree with! The staff have been nothing but polite and helpful and FRIENDLY! Be it in person or on the phone (when they have no idea who I am!) and the one reviewer who insulted Dr. Wong I have no idea where she is coming from.  Dr. Wong has never been any of the things she says.   Dr. Wong has a great sense of humor and is actually very conscious of helping you save some money! My son, who used to be scared of any and al doctors, was actually put to ease by Dr. Wong and her staff.  His first visit there he completely had a meltdown and dr.  Wong and her staff insisted that he pick out a few pairs of glasses to wear home to get used to them (and put he walked with glasses on that had stickers still attached every which way) no questions asked.  They even fit me back into Dr. Wongs busy schedule hours later that was to MY convenience to try to re check his eyes and bring back the glasses.  So to the reviewer who said dr. Wong treated her sister ( who APPARENTLY makes 50k + a year *** is that suppose to be a lot of money? Is she better then everyone else because of this status?) that she was provided with a COUPON ... the nerves!!!

We've eaten there often over the last two years (mainly brunch) The atmosphere is nice, not too fancy not too laid back. The staff is usually attentive(the waitresses are usually nice but the girl that makes reservations on the weekends is usually rude.Not sure if she still works there.) The last two times we went we weren't impressed with the service because we made reservations for brunch and brought our whole family only to be told they they stopped serving breakfast by the time the waitress got to our table. Then the last time we went we were in a rush and we told the hostess/waitress but things still took so long that we ended up missing our appointment. 

Lets get to the food: The fruit is usually fresh and the French toast with blueberry cream cheese is to die for! Their portions are decent and I've never had a meal there that I didn't like. I also like that they typically have things going on like Santa for Christmas, mother day menus and Valentine's Day, etc.

Even my kids were happy with the food & they are NOT Japanese food fans. Kiku prepared the beef teriyaki platter with the teriyaki on the side - so my kids had a delicious steak, rice & veggie dish. 
Highlights :
I LOVEd the avocado salad! Crisp lettuce, perfectly fresh sliced avocado, cucumber & ginger dressing. I will be craving that for months to come. I also really enjoyed their shumai (shrimp dumplings). 
We also had the spring rolls which were very tasty & not greasy. All the side sauces were very good.
My husband enjoyed his sushi very much. The Aloha roll was tasty & very large.   we indulged in 2 desserts - the mango mochi & fried ice cream - all split them both - no complaints!:)

Our server was extremely pleasant & helpful. Cute little atmosphere especially if you get a booth. Seemed to be a date night place for most of the couples in the booths. Only complaint - the background music could have been a little louder. Weird mention, I know, but if you go you'll understand. It's close cozy quarters & extremelyyyy quiet - don't plan on having any private conversations!!

906374,0,4,jFLshsUy_WejR2cv9c_PXQ,"The most amazing Caribbean food I've ever tasted hands down. Brought me back to my trip to the Caribbean and was home style all homemade foods. 
Came here after my sister found this place on Yelp. Thanks yelp! 

Walked up to the store front and it looked like a small take out joint- walked inside and was welcomed by a smiling face and a warm welcome. The menu had so many tasty Caribbean choices on it- I didn't know what I wanted to get. 

I ended up getting a jerk chicken platter/ the kind and welcoming cashier gave us a tip about the jerk chicken and said to get mild if you're not used to spice. So got the mild jerk chicken with rice, and sweet potatoes. 

My sister got some other chicken with Mac n cheese and green beans. While my mom got a Cajun shrimp salad. I also got a side of mango chutney so it could sweeten up the spice. 

There is some seating in the restaurant but not very many. We pushed some tables together and sat and watched the Hobbit movie that was playing on the large tv. 
The food was done quickly and we all dug in. No one talked for about 25 mins- all I heard was ooo and yum and wow this is good... as well as some heavy breathing and panting for the fact that the mild still bad some spice to it. My mouth was on fire but I was loving it! The food was amazing and mouth watering! My mouth and lips seriously got numb but I didn't care I kept on tearing it up! 

The mango chutney helped the spice a lot and the rice also did. I tried my sisters Mac n cheese and it was the cheesy and most delightful meal within itself. The portions here are hefty but do not break your pocket! 

I ended up having leftovers which I later devoured two days later and it tasted just as good. I ordered two sandwiches to go- 2 jerk chicken sandwiches with Mac n cheese for my brother and he was raving about how amazing it was and for the price. 
The cashier told us that they have special bread on Saturday's so it looks like ok going back tomorrow to get my fill.

I thought these were pricey but figured (incorrectly) that the portions would be decent.  My sister got a cup of crab soup and a side of grilled veggies.  The hummus appetizer, for $8.00 consists of a scoop of hummus and two pita breads. The sides were served in small dishes, much like those in diners that  would hold some coleslaw.  There was about one cup of very plain mashed potatoes, and pretty much the same amount of veggies.  Not a problem except that each side was four dollars each.  Really?  My sister had one cup of coffee and I had one cup of tea. The bill came to almost $32.00.  This is ridiculous.

Being a long time experienced server, im going to be critical. We sat with our friends at a table for close to 10min without any menus. We were patient knowing they were busy.  The server came over and said she'd bring us water.  That was many minutes later still without the menus... Again we were not bothered by this, but should have know this was a clue.  She finally gave us menus and small glasses of water after telling her we only wanted water to drink.  The children's drinks arrived long after our waters did. We were seated directly next to the server drink station too.  Our appetizers arrived promptly, but our food took forever.  It also arrived in piece meals which is so wrong.  The kids meals were cold and our server had to be asked for condiments, napkins and water refills (repetitively).  It's something I take pride in when I wait tables, taking the initiative and bringing the guests what they need before they ask.  
 When our food finally arrived it was ok/good. My friend and I shared the fish tacos and lettuce wraps. We got the fish tacos when the kids meals arrived,  but lettuce wraps long after our husbands food arrived.  there was a good 5-10 minutes between them all arriving. She never came back to check on us after the food sever delivered the food.

And once we got to dealer after narrowly avoiding collision on Roosevelt Blvd, found out they missed stuff in breaks and did other stuff wrong.  Tried getting Mr. Tire to step up to the plate and reimburse us for the damage done. They gave us a hard time, and eventually gave us some money back for the improper service.

The sushi probably isn't the best you've ever had, but there's a huge variety and it's perfectly edible. Sure, you can drop $80 at Morimoto or whatever and your taste buds will love you forever, but this is a $7.99 buffet, people. Where exactly are you setting the bar?

The service was super slow.  I would have had an extra beer if the waitress had come back to check on us in 20 minutes or so.  Although, the beer list is also extremely weak with Sam Adams Oktoberfest being the only seasonal beer on tap.  Apparently they didn't get the memo that there are literally hundreds of local craft breweries brewing festbiers, pumpkin ales, and other delicious fall beers right now.  Harpoon UFO is not one of them.

The chicken fingers have a weird processed flavor to them.  The buffalo sauce tastes like it came right out of a bottle.  The coconut shrimp have a weird frozen fishy flavor to them and come with a Thai Chili sauce that also tastes right out of a Franks bottle and canned pineapples.  The worst was a the Buffalo Chicken BLT pizza that had yellow tomatoes on it.  I asked my wife if they bought their tomatoes at Wendy's, because the quality was about the same.

I think part of the problem is this place doesn't know what it wants to be.  The interior atmosphere has a nice, upscale kind of feel, but the menu has the schizophrenia of a diner menu.  Is it Greek?  Is it Italian?  Is it Asian? Is it new American?  All of those items are on the menu, and as a result they don't do any of them particularly well.

Let me start the review by recounting the two unacceptable experiences I had at Kitchen Bar. 

First, at lunch I ordered nachos, and the cheese on the nachos came out with mold on it. There is just no excuse for this, and when I complained and showed the mold to the server, they refused to comp the nachos. I had to argue with a manager to get them to nix the nachos from the bill. 

Second, I ordered a burger, and there was hair in my fries. This one is unacceptable, but not as bad as the moldy nachos. I requested a new plate and was provided with one. 

Breakfast: 

I've always enjoyed the breakfast, I feel the quality of the food is at its peak during the weekend morning rush. 

Lunch & Dinner: 

Aforementioned issues occurred at lunch and dinner. The food quality is at its lowest during these times. I would never eat at Kitchen Bar during these times again. 

Nightlife: 

The music is way too loud. Despite being close to a college campus, the average age of the person going to Kitchen Bar at night is over 40. If that's your demographic great, you may enjoy yourself. If not, there are better bars with cheaper drink prices and less ostentatious DJ's to satisfy your nightlife experience.",JmzNw0WCPmZPZdq5nx9brg,2.0,2011-07-12 14:20:58,oHqMQKxVVN0FIHzxL7kh_A,0,2011-07-12 14:20:58

All in all, if in the area i would dine here again, but not a ""seek out"" visit. As far as service goes, you can hang it up. The servers treat you like they get paid hourly, not off tips.",JmzNw0WCPmZPZdq5nx9brg,3.0,2014-02-19 02:59:58,8UUs1Yfh2k06SmruPS0icg,0,2014-02-19 02:59:58

When we had a superbowl party, the staff was especially nice in asking if we needed assistance loading the car, which we declined, but appreciated the offer.

The bad: Waitstaff seems efficient but not warm or happy (perhaps management isn't too kind on them?). The menu varies quite a bit in price and felt like the prices were gouged on over half of the menu. The portions on some dishes seemed off ~ my boyfriend got the blueberry stuffed french toast and it had only 2 slices of french toast and no sides with it. For $8, that seems silly.

970067,0,1,F7tocwqTLll7mjbnrnU6Yg,"I have been coming to the Kitchen Bar for several years and after my experience yesterday, I will not be patronizing this establishment again.  We started our meal with what has been my all time fav at the Kitchen Bar - French Onion soup.  Maybe it's me, but soup is suppose to be hot - not room temperature.  I don't like to send food back for fear of getting a little special sauce, so I dealt with it.  My husband ordered the french dip, which we have both had umpteen times.  This one was different and lacked flavor and his french fries were cold and chalky.

I ordered the chicken fingers and added the sweet potato fries to make it a meal.  The chicken fingers were overcooked, dry and COLD.  I figured I would take them home and heat them up for a snack the next day that was going to be a snow day.  Then I bit into one of the $4.99 sweet potato fries.  They were COLD.  I mean COLD!  At this point, I am ready to send both plates back, pay for what we ate and get the heck out of there.  However, I know that would have not been fair to our waiter.  So, against my norm, I asked him to have them prepare me a hot order of fries.  Not long after he brought a hot order of sweet potato fries.  I had given up on the chicken fingers so I asked our waiter for some honey for the fries.  

He came back with a jar of ketchup and said that they did not have any honey.  WHAT?!!  They have a robust breakfast menu and they don't have honey!  I refuse to believe that.  My guess is that the honey gets put away at the end of the breakfast hours and they weren't interested in making the customer happy.  NOW, let me say that I have NEVER been served an order of sweet potato fries (usually fresh cut, but these were frozen) without some type of dipping sauce - typically honey, sour cream or some type of aioli.  I am done!  Evidently, they have changed something, perhaps kitchen staff who don't care anything about service and quality or maybe management who could care less as well.  Either way, The Kitchen Bar will not see me again.",JmzNw0WCPmZPZdq5nx9brg,1.0,2017-03-14 21:44:13,qX7x9pHODJgxO7nVaJGmHg,0,2017-03-14 21:44:13

Pork katsu arrived all in one piece rather than sliced as it would be in Japan or any other Japanese restaurant I've ever eaten in.

And they have specials if you want to save some money because it isn't cheap. The food I got was yummy but I couldn't stand their restaurant policy. My friends made reservation but they couldn't seat us till the whole party arrives which is fine but then 30 min later tells us we have to give up our table if they don't show up 15 min from the reservation time. There wasn't anyone waiting for a table at that time but they were giving us a hard time saying restaurant policy and that they already gave us extra time. It was also very late at night and the crowd died down so I didn't understand why the couldn't let it go. In the end we only had 5 people but they sat us at our 10 person table so I don't get what the fuss was about.,JmzNw0WCPmZPZdq5nx9brg,3.0,2013-05-18 02:32:29,h6SY_r3T3iEUEeweWxaYBA,0,2013-05-18 02:32:29

The girl behind the counter looked at it and basically lectured me on the beading. She said they could melt off during the process and thus ruin the dress. She pointed out twice that they would not be responsible if anything happened to it.

After this speech, I was just about ready to snatch up my gown and run out of there. Why would I take a chance on my dress being ruined? Because it was custom made and didn't have a tag, she couldn't give me any type of estimate, elaborate on the process, or answer any questions. Basically she was a human paperweight and kept saying that her dad would have to look at it.

I conceded to speaking to the owner first since he seemed to be the one with the knowledge. After not hearing back, 2 days later I followed up with them and called about the dress. Once I spoke to the owner, he put my mind at ease. He was going to treat it as a wedding dress and was not worried about the beading at all. He gave me a price, a time frame and was friendly. He provided much better service.

The dress was treated beautifully and I was happy with the results. He was even nice enough to carry it out to my car for me. I've since then brought in two other items but I make sure that the owner is there first in case I have any questions.

So obviously thinking I would be getting more oxtail for paying more I went with the LG w/ double Mac. Paid my bill which came to $20 and went about my way. Excited to eat it I opened up the container to only be utterly shocked to see 3 HUGE 3x3"" squares taking up 90% of the platter and 6-7 scraps litterally SCRAPS of oxtails! They were litterally the round bones with a few pieces of gristle around 5 of them and 2 of what I would concider decent or normal pieces that has actual substance of meat to each one.

1032132,2,0,Oebb0nrZono1DHtMsj6qDw,"Ok, we went on a Christmas eve and it was not packed. I guess that should have been the first clue.
 An odd decor with lighted balls on top of the booths that glow different colors.

We sat with a group, no real instructions on what to do. I got up and started getting food. After I sat a woman came over and took the drink request. She was lovely and wished a a Merry Christmas a lot. 

The food, I had very little that I could finish eating. I'm not into seafood, but the group wanted to eat here. I tried things I had not before just to say I had. I had Eel sushi. It was interesting, it tasted mostly like cucumber. I had crayfish, which were sweet and spicy. They tasted like a slightly fishy chicken. 
The non-seafood items was barely edible. Sometimes it tasted fish like. Some odd meat that they called, baby ribs. Which was a flattened piece of meat with a bone here and there. Kind of like a leathery piece of meat. I hope it was not really human. 
Mozarella sticks were slightly cold and lacking flavor. 
Honey chicken was good. 
General Tso's was not good at all. I did not finish it. 

Desserts are all pre-packaged type things. Like ice cream in a cup, the mint and chocolate was good. Pastries I passed on since it was pre-packaged. They did not even bother taking it out of the holder from the box it came from.

Yeah, this is low end of the scale of cheap food in mass quantity. Lot sof choices to eat from, I just didn't want to. 

And one thing I did not understand with the utensils. You are given a fork and a spoon, that is it. No additional utensils are given to you or available anywhere. 
And why no knife? Are they afraid somewhere in the meal you are going to decide to use it for wrong purposes? Not that you need a knife for anything. 
But, they did serve rolls and butter cups if you wanted butter. How would you get it on the bread? I guess that is what the spoon is for? 
The establishment was clean. 
Bathroom for men was clean, but for some reason had a Chinese script taped to the door above men? But, it was not found on the women's restroom door. I wondered what it said and why. 

If you want cheap food you can eat in mass quantity, this is the place. And that is exactly what you are paying for.

I arrived 5 minutes early and was instantly greeted by friendly staff.  Before getting the eye pressure test I had about 10 min to start  picking out frames.  2 super friendly associates and a cheerful receptionist helped and gave their honest opinions.. The young lady that did the initial testing was  pleasant, outgoing and just really good at her job. Im a tough and squirmy patient when it comes to my eyes. She's the first  one ever to get the eye pressure test done in the first 2 tries. FYI Ive had ophthalmologists offices that gave up trying to do the test out of frustration. the dr was great answered lots of questions and gave me lots of suggestions for eye health beyond glasses. As soon as I was done the young lady that did my initial testing, 2 more associates, the receptionist and associate Ray helped me pick the perfect glasses.  I really was impressed at the attention they all gave. Ive never had someone ask me to try on glasses with hair up then hair down.  It really can make a difference in the look.

We were going to go to Chef Vargas but this was on the way back so we decided to give it a shot. Walked in at about 11:30am and the place was a ghost town ON A SATURDAY! that should've been red flag number 1. When we walked in we weren't greeted. There were 2 women behind the hostess desk, one appeared to  be a manager. We literally stood there behind another guest while she figured out how to preform a refund of some sort. Neither her or the host said anything. After 10 minutes we were finally seated. Took another 10 minutes for our server to come over and she clearly didn't want to be there. Zero personality , we felt rushed and we hardly ever seen her. Anyway, after looking over the sticky and extensive menu I decided to get the crab Benedict, it took about 20 minutes to come and when it did IT WAS AWFUL. The egg was not a poached egg it was over cooked and about 30 seconds from being completely boiled, the crab was BLAND and the spinach that came on it was wet, bland and it soaked the English muffin which made it soggy and inedible. The home fries were over cooked MUSH. The bottom of the home fries were BUNRED and extremely crunchy and the rest was damn near mashed potatoes. I flagged down my server & I refused to eat it and ordered something simply thinking they couldn't screw it up. I ended up getting two eggs w/ bacon , toast and home fries. Yet again , the home fries were over cook as well as the eggs. It was pretty horrid, at that point we just ate paid and left. The kitchen is clearly clueless and he staff clearly miserable.

The food was worth 2-3 stars. Some of it wasn't hot, the taste was okay, it was edible (and so far we haven't gotten sick like a couple people mentioned). We wished there had been someone at the hibachi station when we went up to the buffet -- that might have been tastier/fresher. They have a nice assortment of stuff, but again... not the freshest. 

What really makes this a solid 1-star review for me (I wish I could give it negative stars) is the fact that when I went up to the front to pay with my credit card, the lady was extremely rude to us.  I crossed out the ""TIP"" line on my card receipt, because I was going to walk back to the table and put a buck or two down for the lady who refilled our water cups. She sat there and stared at what I was writing, made some comment to her coworker (in another language, likely about the fact that I didn't write a tip in). Then she wasted no time telling us we had to give a tip. My boyfriend and I were both so taken aback and offended (we are not obligated to give anything above the cost of our food), we told her we don't need to give anything if we don't want to, and left. We will never return to this place, I will be watching my credit card statement closely, and I can see we aren't the only ones who don't rate this establishment well for this reason in addition to the sub-par food.

My problem with this is the snarky manager. The young hostess was polite and kindly informed the gentlemen in the group that they needed to wear sleeves and offered them shirts. It was matter of fact, and came rather maturely from the girl.

I would have left right then, had we not been meeting a group. Instead, the guys changed, and I overpaid for a beer and snacked on a plate of fried breading, aka zucchini chips. The ""chips"" were really spiralized zucchini -- really thin strips -- weighed down by heavy breading.

I have gone here a few times.  I went for a late breakfast, which turned into an early lunch by the time they sat our party at a table.   I was a bit annoyed that people came in after us, and got seated before us.  So negative marks for the hostess on Sunday.  The menu was large, but not much variety.  The waiter recommended a specific burger- was average at best.  I also had the nachos...again average at best.  The kids meals were actually the nicest looking meals.  Overall, there are much better places for lunch or breakfast.  The prices are too high for the quality of food and service.  I guess the prices are high to pay for the impressive decor.

The jerk chicken was on point, perfect blend of sweet and spicy, and rice taste different of what I am used to in Latin places, but that was not bad, the taste was different but it was very delicious.  They have the option between normal and large, I highly recommend ording the large one because is only 2 dollars more, and the portion is so big that you can share it with a friend. The sweet plantains were delicious is very hard, to make it without add to much oil and they just know the point of it. 

Again the portion was so big that I had left over for my dinner that day.",fLdPuGl9_fa9PYFYb0gihA,4.0,2017-05-16 02:28:52,ldtxYghu6OLAMxRkkKh3uA,3,2017-05-16 02:28:52

What I dislike about Kitchen Bar is the atmosphere. I've been there a few times in years past, and I remember it being kind of upscale family dining. But in my most recent visit I noticed, while still upscale seeming, I feel like this place is not sure if it wants to be a restaurant or a nightclub. They were pumping 1990s club music, loudly, throughout the restaurant which I found a little irritating. I added a picture of some art on the wall, which was just a silly painting but when your restaurant has artwork that's a play on a strip club, it furthers the notion that they're going for more of a party crowd, and less of a dining crowd. The service was slow and it didn't seem overly crowded. And the people sitting around us were loudly having a pretty vulgar conversation. 

While that last part isn't necessarily within the restaurant's control, I feel like they were setting the atmosphere to invite that kind of lax attitude about what people around them would hear. It wouldn't bother me as much if I weren't trying to celebrate my wedding anniversary over dinner while trying to ignore that, but also trying to hear my wife over the loud beats, while waiting a long time for service. 

I plan on giving Kitchen Bar another chance. This may just be an issue of circumstance, and I really do enjoy their food.

Perfect for dates because it's just loud enough in there that the table next to you won't hear your conversation, and yet chic enough so it doesn't feel like a chain restaurant.

I do love that everyday of the week they have some kind of different food/drink special. They have everything ranging from a pizza buffet to $5 appetizers after 8 PM on Sun, and lots of drink specials. My favorite drink special is the pitcher of Jack for $7. Yes, it's an actual pitcher, so think like 3.5 drinks in one and have it with some lemonade, as our server suggested....splendid.

Appetizers:
I've had a ton of their appetizers and really not loved any. I think the ones I like the most are the Philly cheese steak rolls and the coconut shrimp. Everything else just was ok.

Entree:
 I did have a chicken gyro platter and I was highly impressed. The chicken is definitely not seasoned Mediterranean style (more like regular grilled chicken), but the tzasiki sauce was great and the side salad was excellent AND pretty!

Dessert:
My boyfriend ordered the Xanga tower (I think it's called), it's basically filo dough filled with cheese cake, a side of ice cream and fruit garnish. It did have good flavor, but nothing abnormally fantastic - personally I'd order another pitcher of Jack. :)

One person's phantasm is another persons disappointment. So, it is important to keep that in mind when evaluating a rounder experience. 

This became paramount when I stopped by Abington All Star Bagel on Rt. 611.  The shop was small and clean.  The staff, friendly and helpful.  The bagels in the display, real beauties.  I ordered my standard Onion Bagel with butter and Swiss, and took the bag to go.  

Upon opening the white sack, and unfolding its wrappings, I beheld a large, lovely, heavily onion flaked top, which still carried the aroma of its freshness.  First bite confirmed its recent vintage, and also that it was quite dense and firmly chewy.  Many like this texture in their bagels, but I prefer a crunchier skin and light, airy innards.  

This was not that, but I appreciated the quality of the product nonetheless.  While I would not seek out All Star for my frequent bagel fix, there are others who will find these dough tires the cat's meow.

I thought this was a great chain. My order was forgotten about. Drove all the way here almost an hour away, to get some bubble tea. To make matters worse the staff just laughed at me and talked in a whole other language purposely making fun of me. I looked over the counter and my drink was half way made. Just because I asked where my drink was. Staff seemed annoyed that I disturbed them, all were in the back on their cellphones. Drink was handed to me, and the employee was beyond annoyed. Probably because he was trying to eat food from a whole other location that someone just dropped off for him. He did not apologize. I waited over 15 mins, and I was forgotten about. Horrible, horrible, atrocious customer service. I am never coming back to this location. This location is giving Kung Fu Tea a horrible reputation. There needs to be a real manager during work hours, and not a bunch of teenagers who are getting paid to gossip and be on their cellphones.

Still, the biggest con is the price. (Like 10 bucks for two spring rolls? They're good spring rolls, but not five dollar a piece ones). There really isn't an entree for less than fifteen dollars. And while the food is good, it's not 'great'. 

Aside from that I do really like the interior of the restaurant, they have some weird art going on, so that's a small consolation. And like I said, service has always been good.

Walked in to find a dingy but busy place, filled with what seemed to be locals who seemed on good terms with the owners. All good signs. The menu is set up for you to order platters of some meat, along with your sides, starting from $9 for your cheaper entrees up to the high teens for things like ox-tail stew. Opted to get the classic Jerk Chicken along with Rice&Beans and Cabbage Mix. Waited about 10 minutes while they made the food fresh, and then when the styrofoam case was ready, we began to dig into the delicious mess of food. 

Rice&Beans were moist and flavorful, a great vessel for any sauce to come. The stewed cabbage was savory and had a mild bite, just enough for texture, while being soft enough to devour endlessly. The chicken was of course the star, and with a sweet and tangy jerky sauce that kept us craving more...and I did ask for more. You can also ask for hot sauce, which they will give you on the side, and is indeed quite hot. And as for value, the portion size is giant. The large platters can definitely feed two people reliably, and while there were times were I wished there was chicken:sides ratio could have been higher, that was not so much a problem of being given too little chicken as it was being given a very very generous portion of sides. Not bad for $12-15",fLdPuGl9_fa9PYFYb0gihA,5.0,2019-01-20 09:04:51,KnRAilT8d_88vUODqcZtVw,0,2019-01-20 09:04:51

Service: the hostess was very rude and had an attitude. Practically slammed our utensils down while seating us before walking away without a single word. Waiter was nice enough but seemed inexperienced. 

Food: we ordered the Italian panini and Moussaka. The vegetable soup du jour that came with the meal was just salty, nothing special. The panini had a thick piece of grilled chicken in it that was both VERY dry and VERY bland. Even salt and pepper couldn't save it. The moussaka was super bland too. We upgraded the other soup to a house salad, which was the only enjoyable dish we had.

So After going there almost 10 times since it`s opening, I will have to give this place a strong 5 stars due to mostly one department, the Sushi.

Breaking down other areas, the new look of the restaurant is really nice, the bathrooms, are clean, and beautiful looking especially the sink. Staff, is sometime`s friendly, sometimes they just keep to themselves, but never really any attitude from them. 

Other food has its up`s and downs, Egg Rolls are amazing, chicken and broccoli, hibiachi chicken, and few other items, taste really good, the ice cream bars are actually better than other all you can eat Chinese places which have the ice cream machines.

My boyfriend got the winter melon milk tea with mango popping bubbles and it was pretty good, too.

They also have small appetizers and crepes. The crepes look delicious. I'll have to try one during my next visit.

UPDATE: April 2017 (Took away another star and we won't return again.)
Went for updated eye exams with my fiance on a Saturday morning. We have different vision insurance plans, so we specifically came to America's Best after checking their website ahead of time and seeing that they accept both plans. As we were checking in with the receptionist, I told her the name of my plan and she said they didn't accept it. I mentioned I was confused, because the website said they accepted it, and she rudely replied, ""Well the website ALSO says to CALL and CONFIRM that your plan is accepted."" I was unsure if I am misunderstanding her tone, but she came off as rude.

My fiance ended up going ahead and getting his exam anyway, since we were already there. He took the clipboard to the back to waiting area to fill in his basic info. About 10-15 mins later the receptionist walks back to us and says, ""I GUESS you didn't HEAR ME when I said ""bring the clipboard BACK TO ME when you are done."" Yes, we made a mistake/didn't hear her, but there are several ways she could have said that (like ""Are you all set?"") that would not have been rude to us, the customers. It was clear at this point that I did not misunderstand her tone with me when we first arrived.

The few parking spots in front are right off of 611, which is a busy avenue. Definitely signal ahead of time before turning in! And I always see the same red car parked out front. Either someone really likes this place or a worker is taking up the already limited parking lot..

I got a medium taro milk tea which was pretty sweet, even though I ordered the reduced sugar (30% sugar) option. It just tasted artificial.

What really left a bad taste in my mouth was the credit card minimum. Now, I understand why businesses do it (the credit card will charge a % to the business, but will have a minimum $ charge per transaction).  But a $15 minimum for a tea house?  I found this outrageous for that type of business.  Imagine walking into a Starbucks for a cup of coffee, and seeing a $15 minimum charge for credit cards. Crazy right?? Who buys $15 worth of Starbucks in one visit?  Well, that's what they expect at Kung Fu Tea if you want to use a credit card - $15 worth of tea!  

I ordered a large taro but was short about 30 cents.  I told the cashier I didn't have enough cash, but have a credit card. (I saw the sign posted, just thought he would let me slide).

I got the taro milk tea which was absolutely perfect. Not too milky, perfect amount of sugar.... just perfection in every sip... when we arrived, the parking lot was packed and was only able to park in the back. When we saw their sign on their front door, it said that anyone who parks in the back would get towed... well, that's fine, we were only there for about 20 minutes considered the line was at the door and it took about 5 minutes for our drinks to be ready. They do have a $15 credit card minimum as well, so remember to bring cash if you're not planning on spending $15 on drinks/ finger foods. All seating was taken, so we just ended up going in our car enjoying our drinks.. I would absolutely give this a 5 star, but their seating is limited. I find the couches to not be a great use of space as it's a bit awkward sitting on the same couch with another couple... Wish they had tables so you can study. They do have some seating that's on the side, but it's pretty limited... maybe 4 sAlso, the whole parking situation is a bit odd. Yet, this is the best tasting boba tea place I've been to that's not in Philly! 

Edit: Had to use the ATM to get some cash to buy a drink. Fair WARNING... the ATM says it would charge you $2 for taking money out, but it charges you $4.50. I looked at my account and it not only charged me $2 ($22 as I wanted a twenty dollar bill) but an extra $2.50 as a separate transaction. Not sure why, but made me a little annoyed...

Had a great appetizer and drink before my meal. I recommend the Philly Cheesesteak Spring Rolls to start out with (see photo)...what a new twist on two favorites, and a tasty app!  Very good stuff.  I also tried one of their specialty drinks, the Loco Raspberry Margarita...two thumbs up.

For my main entree, I got the Chicken Marsala.  It was great as well, it didn't last very long on the plate once it arrived.  The menu is very diverse, many different entrees for any taste or preference.

Service was good and friendly, if not a bit busy and hurried but that means business was good.  

Overall, a unique and tasty stop if you get the chance to go.",JmzNw0WCPmZPZdq5nx9brg,4.0,2011-05-16 22:44:33,TAV_X0gbPs4JT3he50CtLg,0,2011-05-16 22:44:33

With scenic walking trails, an outdoor classroom, day camps and a small indoor animal habitat, Briar Bush is a great spot for small children, couples on a date, or anyone looking for a brief respite from the urgency of the modern world.

With free admission for locals and a small fee for out-of-towners, the preserve is accessible to all patrons provided that they are able to walk down some wooded trails that circle through the admittedly short walking routes. The centerpiece of the trails is a picturesque, secluded pond with benches for sitting and an interactive sign with information on the local fauna and flora. 

The indoor animal habitat has a small gift shop, pamphlets on upcoming events and information on other parks in the area, and several interesting animals such as a blind possum named Odin, a bearded lizard named Karl, and several other unique turtles and reptiles.

All of Briar Bush can be walked through in an hour or so, but the low admission, interactive nature events and scenic walking trails will have you wanting to return again soon.",ZtUhhZ67eoHg30c-nPXC1Q,5.0,2018-08-27 01:06:50,y8jJ9rC-g39N-GhI-Wlo8g,1,2018-08-27 01:06:50

This was a Wednesday night so it wasn't crowded, and there were two servers handling the dining room. When we did get the attention of one of the servers, he apologized and claimed he didn't know he had our table. I  don't know how that works as when you come in for your shift as a server, you typically go to the host stand and find out what your section is. Also, when I worked as a server, if I saw someone sitting a long time with no drinks, I'd offer to get them drinks at least so they don't walk out and then I could locate their server.

So when it came time to get drinks, food etc, it took a long ass time! 

When it came to the drinks, they tasted okay, but weren't anything spectacular. We had ordered a few apps which included nachos and a spinach dip, and the chips were stale, and the dip was watery. Not a great start! The nachos were huge and shareable, but they weren't the best either. 

The drinks were very strong which was a good thing, and I wondered why they would make them so strong! Prob so people would be drunk quickly and wouldn't taste the garbage they were serving to customers and calling it food. 

We had an issue with on of our drinks and complained about it, and were told they would make a new one for us, only to wait our entire meal waiting for our drink to come out.

The one thing my wife and I liked first was that kids under 3 eat for free, which we have two kids who met that criteria. 

   Alright so to start off with the place, the remodeling of everything looks nice, the seating arrangements give you more privacy than the old place had, which just seemed like a huge open floor of seating. The food had it`s up and downs on what someone would particularly like. My personal high recommendations would be the beef on a stick, honey chicken, egg rolls, yummy yummy sushi, and the spicy shrimp sushi.  My wife and I plan on going back just to get the Yummy yummy sushi because we haven't seen or tasted anything like that anywhere else, which consists on a sweet intake at first then you get a hit a spicy hit at the end, the best kind of Sushi I`ve ever had was that particular kind. 

   The downs I speak of, are which would  mostly be the thing items that are NOT commonly on the Chinese restaurant menu, which are the fries, pizza, etc. It didn't look appealing at all, but I give them a A on trying meet everyone needs. The waitress was on top of clearing our tables so that good as well.

   The end result, we had a good meal, I`m not saying this is a 4 star restaurant, but I will give it 4 stars for a buffet, and the price. Something I was kind of disappointed with was that they do not have a ice cream machine, which I'm use to from all the buffets I go too. I was actually looking forward to that at the end, but they did have sliding door reach in freezer with ice cream bars and ect. So still a A for trying to replicate that experience.

A nature center/museum and I don't have to do the drive downtown/pay for parking...and admission is free for Abington residents/friends of Briar Bush? Amazing.  (Admission otherwise is only $3 for adults and $2 for kids 2-17).  

There's animals/insects inside such as owls, huge cockroaches, giant turtle, snakes.  And a cute reading corner full of nature books.  There's also a discovery den AKA play area indoors for $1.  

There's animals/insects outdoors such as turkey vultures, turtles, a butterfly house and a bird observatory (cute on the inside with toys for the kiddos - be sure to read the story about the couple who opened the center).  And a natural playscape outdoors.  There's also a bunch of fairy houses throughout the property that girl scouts donated.  And lots of trails through the forest.

They also have Magic Mornings for ages 2-4 Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays - but register ahead as they only have a certain amount of spots each day (it's seasonal - they have in fall and spring but not summer - see website).  It's an hour class for $10 and includes a snack, craft, nature walk etc.  They usually pull out an animal each class.  It's great to get some time in nature with other kids.  

In summer, they have a full week of Magic Mornings in their Itty Bitty Briar Camp.  Ms. Heidi teaches it and she is just great.  They have a different theme every day such as sun, water, clouds etc and there's an activity each day (visit pond and catch tadpoles, water play, craft pertaining to theme).  

They have preschool pioneers for ages 4-5 and summer camp for older kids for a week in late June.  

*Just beware in June that parking is limited due to school field trips and you may not fit in either of the lots; you may have to park out front of the house to the left (which is fine - she just doesn't want buses idling there)

They also have field trips to gardens and to the shore, classes for seniors, family nature nights, hot smores nights...

Only negative (besides parking, which they can't really control), is the ""snacks"" for kids at Magic Mornings aren't the healthiest.  One was cinnamon sugar graham crackers with whipped cream- regular would have been fine.  2 days were cheddar gold fish.  Another day was blue jello with whipped cream.  And some red licorice - the kind that whips.  Fruit Loops were used for colors.  So, if you don't like your child eating sugar, let them know you have a dietary restriction or bring your own snack (snack time is ~10 min and probably not needed but the kids always love snack time!).  Some options that would be healthier and just as easy would be pretzel sticks, fruit, crackers, popcorn, veggies, string cheese...but I guess those all cost more besides pretzels/crackers/popcorn.",ZtUhhZ67eoHg30c-nPXC1Q,5.0,2016-06-24 21:07:37,bbZFiGdRJlxs1ys5RYfZWA,1,2016-06-24 21:07:37

Though I initially came for the brisket, they were out. Instead, I chose the roast beef hoagie. Knowing my temperaments and preferences, I opted for the Muenster cheese over the sharp provolone or American. I recommend you do the same.

The hoagie roll was perfectly soft and chewy. The serving size of roast beef was healthy. The beef was uber thin, moist, and tender. There was no stick on the bite or gristle catching in between my teeth. The horseradish added astringent elements. The cheese contributed a demure smoothness in mouth feel that transitioned the bite from meat to bread in a cooling and creamy manner.

My only addition would be a bit more fat in some form, and a Maillard flavor (charrred beef bits, charred onions/shallots/etc). As it was, this was an excellent hoagie.

1.  They put together a large round table and pushed next to it a small square/rectangle table usually for two.  It was an awkward configuration at the end of the isle.   When I saw it,  I asked why they did not just put two of the longer rectangular tables end to end for our party.  Hostess answered:  Manager told me to do it.  I suggested that the other approach would be better for our party and she ignored me and walked away.
2.  The next party that came in that was large they did exactly what I had suggested--for them. 
3.  The 'two' table was very wobbly.  Manager came over, pushed it back and forth a few times and said she would get another table.  She never did and we fixed it ourselves so it would stay still.  
4.  When our food arrived, all lunch items, one of our party did not get her food.  It did not  arrive for 15 minutes.  My hamburger, which I ordered without onions as I am allergic, came out with onions (but no tomato which was  supposed to be with the lettuce).  
5. When one of our party, the woman who waited so long for her turkey club, drank her unsweetened ice tea down to about 1/2 of the glass she noticed a crusty ring around the inside of the glass.  She did not notice it before because of the color of the tea.  She tested it with her knife and it was definitely crusted inside the glass in a ring.  I called the waitress over and showed it to her,  clearly the glass had been refilled dirty.  I saw our waitress then talking to Margaret, the Manager about it and then she disappeared.  Margaret walked over and stood next to us and said 'How is everything here?"".  I said you know about the glass --what kind of question is that?  Her answer ""we will take the ice tea off the bill.  That was it , no concern, no outrage, no comment about what they were doing in the dish washing area to make sure this would not happen again etc.  None of what you would expect  a manager to do or say.  
6.  One final.  when our food was brought out on a tray  by a food server I noticed that she was carrying it  up high toward her right shoulder.  Lo and behold, her hair , that  was hanging down her back brushed across some of the food as she twisted to put the tray down.  I was so disgusted at that point by the  rudeness of the  hostess and the table setup issue that I just figured lets get this done  and over with.  I had suggested the place and if I had made a scene about the hair not being up and away from the food all the food on the tray would have gone back.  Considering the next events  I should have said something and we all should have left.  
6.  When we got up to leave I spoke to the waitress.  I told her I was shocked by the Managers attitude about the dirty glass, all of us were disgusted.  She told me the Manager basically asked her why she did not see it herself.  The waitress was very upset.  
7.  As we walked out the Manager tried to give us coupons to use when we returned.  I told her we would not be back, that my guests were disgusted and that I would be in touch with the family that owns the restaurant.  
I am very disappointed and would not return, neither would the rest of my party and I will be following through in contacting the owners.",JmzNw0WCPmZPZdq5nx9brg,1.0,2016-06-11 20:51:21,k3IXnqRPzLBnPgRQE6xGnw,0,2016-06-11 20:51:21
1374091,0,3,bZ3-H8lWCtYCYiNoG5qUaw,"I am extremely disappointed with my most recent experience at Kitchen Bar. 

My two friends from Pittsburgh and I went to brunch there on Sunday. I was really excited to take them, since it's one of my favorite places. We were happy with our food- as always, but the service was abysmal. 

We ordered the egg sandwich on a pretzel, Tex Mex omelet, and California omelet. Everything was very good.

Our waitress acted like we were deeply inconveniencing her every time we asked for anything...such as a refill, or ketchup, or really anything at all. She was rude and unpleasant, sighing when we asked her anything and storming away. 

She FINALLY dropped off our check, and then we waited 20 minutes. She walked by...nothing. I finally had enough and went up to the front to take care of the bill, and then she appeared in a flash to take care of it...obviously because she was looking to enter her tips. I thought that was incredibly rude. I attempted to speak to the hostess about the service, but she was off in her own world and didn't really listen. 

When she brought us the checks, she offered a half-hearted apology- which we knew was phony and in a last-ditch effort to get a decent tip.  I am tired of hearing the same lame excuses ""Oh, we just got so busy!"" I completely understand that, but being busy is not an excuse for being incredibly RUDE. She didn't even bring out our meals (someone else does that here), so she truly did nothing for our table without complaining about it.

One of my friends who joined me last Sunday had been a server for many years, and her husband actually is a restaurant manager in Pittsburgh. She also felt that the service was truly terrible- and we are not exactly the type of people who complain about servers since we do understand that it can be a high-stress job.

It was truly embarassing to take my close friends to this place and have it turn out this way. I will not be coming back to Kitchen Bar for a while, if ever- they need to fix their issues with speed of service, but more importantly, need to get some servers who don't act as if they hate people. When you provide VERY loyal customers with terrible service, you'll lose them- just like you've lost me.",JmzNw0WCPmZPZdq5nx9brg,1.0,2014-08-19 15:26:42,nzm6MM_2mc2TN3EyiceqvQ,1,2014-08-19 15:26:42

We didn't realize it was a small grab and go place so we were expecting to eat there. Much to our surprise, there was only one table with two chairs so we took it to go. Regardless, the food was worth it. 

We both got the Span-ish, but one of us got chicken and the other got pork. It was delicious, but the bread could have been toasted a little more. There were two people working when we were there and both of them were super friendly and welcoming. Out food was made right in front of us and didn't take very long.

This time we opted for a mango slush with bubbles and a chai milk with bubbles.  I don't like things that have too much sugar so I got the chai milk with ""less sugar"". The other options were half sugar and no sugar. It was just sweet enough. Next time I may try no sweet.  The mango slush was not too thick or sweet.

The store was closed and it was the weekend. I called back on Monday and the person that answered stated that the circles were some type of chemical used to protect the glasses while being made. She told me to get some cleaner and clean them off. 

 I will be taking them back to the store. 
Note: when picking up my glasses several people were coming back with complaints of circles on the bottom of their glasses and they were told that it was the way they were cut and they would correct them.

Why would they not check the glasses to make sure they are cut or prepared correctly before giving them to the customer.

1394110,1,3,npJBT0RrDu6cqt5Gjlpxcw,"I came across this place while I was working in the area. You'll turn into a small lot and will be surprised when you see the front of the restaurant. It looked like there may have been some parking around the back as well. This is a small restaurant that has a handful of tables. It was a little dark inside and it felt like going into someone's basement. 

I went in looking to try the curry goat, but I decided to try the jerk chicken. I got a large platter and chose the Mac and cheese as the carb and callaloo as the vegetable.
Jerk chicken - I was really excited to try the jerk chicken, but I wasn't a fan. The large platter came with four pieces that tasted pretty good. The flavors didn't do it for me though - they didn't give me that jerk chicken taste and spice that I'm used to. It is a saucy kind of jerk chicken and tasted more like a sweet BBQ sauce to me. 

Mac and cheese - You can tell the Mac and cheese has some real cheese mixed inside, but it had a weird texture that felt like I was eating mushed up pasta. There was a layer of cheese on top that was hard, even after being microwaving my leftovers later that night.

Callaloo - This is compared to a spinach cream. I really liked this! It came in a separate container and was made of a mix of vegetables and this restaurant mixes in okra into theirs. I recommend getting this as a vegetable side. 

I would give this place 3.5 stars if I could. I was leaning towards three stars, but I'm giving them four stars because I can tell the authenticity in the food and I think other dishes will be better.

I went with my son and husband, thinking that it was a simple pho place. Instead, it's a beautifully decorated, elegant place with tons of dark and cherry wood tones, intricate teak carvings on the walls, and jeweled wall hangings. 

We shared the appetizer sampler, consisting of curried grilled chicken and steak, crispy egg rolls (can substitute spring roll), curry puffs (flaky puff pastry filled with curried potato and chicken - very samosa-like), tulip roll ( steamed dumpling with shrimp and crab), and shrimp wrapped in wonton skin and fried. I then had shrimp pho, my son had traditional steak pho, and my husband had the drunken noodles. Everything was fresh, service was fast but not hurried.

When I told him I saw the car driving, he immediately changed his tune and said it was a required test drive. It was no where near the shop. I told him to call and have the car brought back. 
I returned immediately and took my car without them completing the inspection.

I was always aware of Goodfellas and this past Sunday, decided to give them a try for the first time.

The menu I had listed a ""Sunday Special"" which is a pizza with one topping for $9.99. It sounded good to me and I called to ask about it. They confirmed they still had that special and asked what topping I would like. Extra cheese, please.

The pizza arrived in a timely matter but there was NO extra cheese on it. Or, if this is their version of extra cheese, I would really like to see what it looks like without it. Basically, I didn't get my free topping and I'm complaining about it here. However from the other reviews, it sounds like this place really skimps on the ingredients. I don't think they forgot because the man on the phone asked what topping I wanted. 

The regular, plain pizza I received was ok. It arrived hot and the crust was chewy. Overall it wasn't great and I can't see myself ordering from them again with so many other options around. Unfortunately, I feel that there are a lot of other pizza places that do a better job.",Uvh7cAuI4dFso3HKT2zHyw,2.0,2016-09-21 18:04:36,GYt3N67dTDXsMB9jSbk14Q,2,2016-09-21 18:04:36
1525289,0,3,mYVdETHXVsjsflSU7rT_LQ,"Go ahead and read the reviews before me. I usually don't write reviews of restaurants, even thought we eat out a lot. But I""m making an exception here because this place had been one of our 'regulars."" I'd say, when under the old management, we ate here at least once a month. Then, to our chagrin, it closed.

We actually didn't know this until the exterior was inexplicably repainted to the bizarre pinkish-purple color you now see. When we went on line to see what was going on, we (my wife and I) read all of the horrible reviews. Everything was being panned, from the food, to the service, to the decor . . . well, you can read it all for yourself. We avoided going back because of all the bad reviews.

But then, some one we actually knew went there and they said that it was fine, so we decided to give it a whirl ourselves.

Other than moving the receptionist station, and mounting a modest size flat screen TV on the wall, the decor was exactly the same. Whilst other people have criticized the decor, we kinda like it. The original owner once explained to us that the3-D  wood carvings they have mounted in the wall are cut out of a single piece of wood. If you look at them closely, they're really pretty impressive. We don't mind the all the Asian accessories -- little dolls, wooden elephants, etc. Gives the place its character.

We also like the fact that this is a BYOB, which really cuts down on the cost of a meal.

The menu, however, was completely different. There is a much larger selection of items to be had, we're both vegetarians (will eat fish, though), so the actual number of options for us was probably about the same as under the previous owner.

I have to say, we really liked the food better under the old menu. We ordered the spring rolls as an appetizer and expected them to be hot. They were cold, and had very little flavor. The sauce they included with it had some very nice spices in it, but not enough to compensate for the largely tasteless and overly chewy spring rolls.

We ordered an entree off the ""tradtional"" selections. We picked the vegetables with Ginger sauce and had the salmon added. The salmon was cooked well, and the ginger sauce was nice, and vegetables were well cooked, but not very flavorful. It was totally eatable but nothing that you really could rave about.

We also ordered the Drunken Noodles with Tofu. This was probably the best of the dishes we had. Good flavors and well done. But it was served without rice. I had to ask for some rice, and the waitress promptly brought us a tiny bowl (think coffee cup size) for the two of us. Seeing us immediately empty the bowl (half each) onto our place, she asked if we wanted another bowl, and brought one out.

Speaking of service, it really was very good. We were immediately greeted by the hostess (who was watching TV on her computer). All of the tables around the windows were occupied except one, which she gave to us (the entire center part of the restaurant was empty, but this was fairly late on a Wednesday night).

The waitress immediately as us if we wanted our wine bottle opened, and checked in on us while we were looking over the menu. when we were ready to order, she was there. The food came out within a reasonable time-frame, and was hot.

The net of all this is the 3-star rating we gave. We were neither turned off by the experience nor were we wowed in any way. We certainly might go back again some time in the future for a change of pace, but it's not good enough to be a frequent dining destination for us.

No wilted basil on my plate; see pics. The portion is smaller but any Pho restaurant outside the city serves the same way. The spring rolls are better here, too. I'm not a fan of them but would order them again next time I'm at the restaurant. 

I have a feeling there is more of a Thai influence but not having eaten Pho in Vietnam personally, that could be open to debate. Who knows which bowl of Pho is the most authentic.

The overall layout of the store is nice and it is clean but the customer service and advertisements are horrendous. My wife came in with the intention to use her Labor Day coupon from Michaels which states that you may get one item which is regular price at a 50% discount with this coupon. So we looked around and she found some stickers that were regular price and she decided to buy them and when we got to the cashier she scanned our coupon and while I was analyzing the price I noticed the discount was not applied. I asked why? And was told certain items even at regular price would not honor the coupon for they are under a special category called ""Everyday Value Program"" I really didn't understand and really felt as though this was false advertising. I also didn't understand why the cashier scanned the coupon in the 1st place if she knew we wouldn't get a discount, then she tried to scan another coupon which did nothing for us anyways. I know it wasn't the cashier's fault because she's probably only making $8.00 an hour what the hell does she care or give a shit in that matter. Anyhow since my wife really liked the stickers I ended up buying them reluctantly. Overall the service is really nonchalant here and the workers could really could care less. Everything is pretty much overpriced and made in China for the most part and even with these 50% discounts you are still overpaying. The only + thing I can say from this experience is that I managed to get some small bowls for $3.00 which was a good value, other than that Michaels just ended up stealing $5.00 from me today based on there bullshit fake advertising.

Maybe this Michaels is still in the hiring process, and perhaps this can just be chalked up to a learning curve in the new store, but I have found that sometimes there are not enough cashiers, and many of them have seemed less than thrilled to be there, and do not always honor coupons correctly.   I had a 40% off any item coupon to use and about $100 worth of items in my cart, ranging from $.75 to $25.  The 40% off was used on my seventy-five cent item.  When I asked about it, the cashier suggested that I purchase a camera that was behind the counter, as the 40% coupon was applicable to it.   I politely declined, of course, but was curious as to why none of my larger ticket items were able to receive the 40% discount.  The cashier seemed upset that I was asking about it, so I cut my losses.  Another time, I went to retrieve a coupon from my email, and it was taking some time to load.  The cashier told me she would make a one-time exception, which I appreciated, but she seemed very put off by the situation.   And practically every time I have checked out, I am not asked for my email/rewards number, and when I ask if I can give it, I am met with confusion.

1565529,0,2,pwNZ2eTc1VHDY_qM_Gi8jA,"I was debating between giving Tien Thai Pho four or five stars, but I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and hand them a five star rating. Let's go over a few aspects of the restaurant.

The decor outside is pretty tacky and odd, but once you walk in, it's quite appealing to the eye. Intricate wood carvings and good service make Tien Thai a great place to dine in. I did notice that the entire staff consisted of young individuals, mostly college students like myself, but this does not take away from the fact that they promptly sat me and my friends down and quickly took our order. Our food was ready and brought out to us in 10 minutes, and our main dishes were brought out in another 20 minutes.

The times that I went, they had a $10 lunch special, where one can order an appetizer, salad, and an entree. My first time there, I ordered a salad (don't remember the specific one), a golden triangle, and the drunken noodles with beef. The salad was fresh, crisp, and delicious. The golden triangle seemed a bit overcooked, but great nonetheless. The drunken noodles had a decent ratio of beef to noodles. The meat was cooked to perfection, and the sauce really tied the whole dish together. My one friend had the spring rolls and the Pad Thai with Beef, and she said she enjoyed her dish. My other friend had the pork with rice and didn't finish her dish, but she was tired and even though she didn't finish her dish, she said she liked it.

The other times I went, I had the Pad Thai with chicken and the Pho and I have to say that both dishes were very good, and the Pho was pretty good compared to the Pho places in Chinatown.

*** This place is BYOB! So if you want to come in and get your wine and dine on, this is a nice spot to come to.

Overall, I have to say that the food and service is a solid 9/10. The outside decor is pretty tacky but once you walk in, you'll definitely be there to stay, so I give the decor about a 8/10. There is a spacious parking lot so you don't have to worry about looking for parking.

The place even has Bugs (Flying Ants) and the tables are sticky...

The waitress didn't even know a word of Vietnamese, she didn't even know anything on the menu in Vietnamese. I would expect if you worked at the place you should know the menu. Specially Pho Thai and Goi Guon which EVERYONE orders.

The Pho was basically MSG + Water + Uncooked Noodles.
The Goi Guon's Peanut sauce wasnt even the Vietnamese kind, which you could buy anywhere.
The Mint and Greens were wilted and old.
They didnt even cough up the money to buy SRIRACHA!!
instead they use some generic no name watered down brand.

I came here for lunch, and the Pho was only $8 and for $10 you could get Pho + an appetizer, or a Thai entree + an appetizer.

I ordered Pho, and my friend had a Thai dish.  Both were excellent.  The Pho was very fresh, and the ingredients on the side were fresh.  It came with the full complement: hot peppers, basil, bean sprouts, and lime, and the usual two sauces.

I won't say that this place has the best Pho I've ever had, but it was solidly good--in the five star range, but what really makes this five stars, in my opinion, was that both the Thai food and the Pho were good.

I also thought that the service was very good.  The atmosphere is a bit odd...it does look a little like a cabin.  But it's cozy and spacious at the same time, which was kind of cool.  There's a massive parking lot that looks like it's about 4 times as big as needed for this place.

So we decided that we'd be adventurous and find some place along the way.

We passed Tien Thai Pho - and we were both on the fence.  So, I turned to yelp - decent reviews, not bad / not great ... but the one constant was that most reviewers thought the Thai was pretty good, while the Vietnamese was pretty lousy.

So, we stayed w/ the Thai portion of the menu and ordered the Sea of Love and the Seafood Pad Thai.  Although they were out of mussels and scallops (ingredients in the Sea of Love) they indicated they would add additional squid and something else.

Tien Thai pho has taken over what used to be Thai Thanee. The decor of the restaurant remains the same, sans the new sign with the business name. The one thing I immediately noticed when I sat down was that the restaurant smelled of fish sauce... and the table cloth(?) was sticky. There was also a huge flying ant walking around the table like it owned the place.. yeeesh..

They must have re-used the utensils from the Thai Thanee days, as the silverware had obvious signs of wearing (the restaurant is fairly new). And the chopsticks we received were the wooden disposable ones...talk about tacky o_0

We ordered goi cuon (spring rolls) for an appetizer, pho dac biet (specal pho) and pho tai (brisket pho) as an entree. To my surprise, the waitress did not speak any Vietnamese because she had no idea what we were ordering! Is it snobby of me to note this? Why have the menu in Vietnamese in the first place? '

When our plate of garnishes arrived, the herbs were obviously wilted and going bad. Then came our entrees.. the pho broth was nothing but MSG and lukewarm water! As Lo L. noted in her review, there was definitely something going on with the noodles. They were clumped together and were cooked unevenly, if even cooked at all. My pho dac biet was on the skimpy side with the meat - I only noticed two.. two!! thinly sliced pieces of tripe :( As for the goi cuon appetizer, I don't know what went wrong with the dipping sauce... it was very watered down and oddly sweet. The rolls were ice cold. The food made my tummy feel funny =( 

Service was lacking, especially for a restaurant with an occupancy of three tables (including us). After we barely finished our food, we waited around for ten minutes in hopes for the waitress to come with the check. And she never came. I had to flag one of them down.. 

Unfortunately, Tien Thai Pho doesn't cut it for me. I would definitely 
drive the additional 20 minutes to venture out into Philly for pho... where you definitely get your bang for the buck.",R4BGGSaz0y5Bq2bCWDQAQg,1.0,2011-08-11 20:22:02,74MEs3l1jQTaBPpOgv8t7w,3,2011-08-11 20:22:02

1664823,0,0,jK7brfPiHHfGJXb0eLnfyw,"We took our car to the Firestone in Abington, PA for a state inspection a week or so ago. It passed the emissions test, but failed the safety inspection. Firestone told us we needed 3 major things done to our car in order to pass inspection, totaling over $1,000. They suggested another $2,000 in ""preventive"" maintenance.

We usually take our car to our Honda dealer for routine maintenance and major repairs, but they are over 40 minutes away so we go to Firestone for tires and other minor issues because they are nearby. 

We didn't think Honda could have overlooked these safety issues when doing routine maintenance so we decided to take the car to them for a second opinion. They told us nothing was wrong with the car, so we told them what Firestone had said and asked them to take a second look. They said they could not find anything wrong. 

We can only surmise that someone at Firestone - either on their own, or at the direction of management - made up these repairs to increase profits. We believe Honda over Firestone because our car is 12 years old and Honda knows we will be car shopping in the near future and they would not want to lose our business. 

Here's the kicker - in talking to the service rep at Honda we learned that in the state of PA (we're from MA) the manner in which a car is inspected is totally arbitrary, creating lots of room for dirty dealings. It's ridiculous! No other state I have lived in (I have lived in 8) performs their annual inspections this way. My next letter will be to the state of Pennsylvania.

We have had very good service from Firestone in the past, but this brings serious questions to light about their honesty. I called today to ask if there had been an ownership or management change recently, and I was told that yes there had been, about a year ago. Maybe that accounts for what happened to us.",X62ejibJII2WlVIA4KKKaA,1.0,2018-09-11 17:32:15,h9LNV37G-LC9EuUAkGIU8g,0,2018-09-11 17:32:15

In addition to a few other items, we ordered the Abington Special which consists of a large plain cheese pizza, a cheesesteak, FF and a 2 liter bottle of soda.  The pizza was pretty bad.  All the cheese in the middle of the pie was stuck to the inside of the top of the box.  Plus, there was hardly any sauce on the pizza, so because most of the cheese was stuck to the box, the only thing left was the crust.  We had asked for extra onions on the cheesesteak and were told there would be an extra charge for that, which we agreed to pay.  When we tasted the cheesesteak, not only were there no EXTRA onions, there were hardly ANY onions at all.  The steak had a ""funny"" taste in general and we ended up not eating it.  We also ordered a sandwich, and it too had a ""funny"" taste.   I can't describe it, but it was offputting enough so that it ended up in the trash with the cheesesteak and the pizza.  There was, however, one saving grace.  We had ordered some desserts.  Their cheesecake was divine, as was their chocolate mousse cake, which was to die for.   Bottom line:  If you go there, just go for dessert.  

A suggestion to Goodfellas:  Get some of those little plastic gadgets that most other pizza places use that sit on top of the pizza right in the middle which prevents the top of the box from making contact with the pizza, keeping the cheese intact.

CONS : 
- We went inside and waited for 2 minutes for SOMEONE in the restaurant to greet us and to sit us down. With no hope of anyone coming outside, my friend had to KNOCK on their kitchen door to find someone.
- We ordered their version of a summer roll. It was overly expensive and had a horrible taste. The summer rolls were small. The peanut sauce was average. The vermicelli noodles were ""frozen"" so it all clumped together and was very hard to chew. I'm usually a slow eater, but one summer roll took me about two mouthfuls. 
- The pho finally came in after waiting 15 minutes. The broth, had steam coming out, but was just a bit over warm. It did not cook my basil leaves nor the bean sprouts. 
- The pho I ordered was the special, so it had a lot of different meats inside. Usually when you go to a pho place and have meatballs inside, it can vary from 3 to 5 meatballs. This one? It was one meatball cut into four small pieces. 
- When we finally finished our food, we were given the check and was told that she will come back to get it. We waited for around 10 minutes and the waitress never came back. We saw another table just leave after putting the money on the table so we did the same.

What an amazing restaurant. I have been going here for a long time and I have finally been able to put into words what I want to say. 

An amazing stand-alone restaurant. With carved elephant pillars at the entrance with amazing sculptures just inside the front door. Step inside to an amazing Koi fish tank with the legendary upside down fish. :) Check out the shrine, amazing hand-made miniature pagodas and the hand-crafted teak-wood relief - truly AMAZING!!!! Don't forget to check out the water-dragons watching over the Koi and the kids will always want to sit on the Elephants.  Sit down under some nice fire-blossom lights - ( need energy efficient bulbs) ;-) Kat, Amber and Jenny really amazing and so are the day time waiters.  Be sure to check out the restrooms which are very clean, soap is always plentiful  and paper hand-towels to boot!

Ok I'll start with the PROS:
The owner is so kind he comes out to say hi and there is an elder women who does a lot of prep she is such a kind lady. Always smiling. Be sure to say hi if you see her. :) I usually get seated quickly  and water and tea follows. I usually start with an appetizer and all their dumplings are very good from the buddha dumplings/veggie, curry puffs and lotus dumplings - look like lotus flower are all very good. Their pho is good and what makes it better is the atmosphere, artwork and music - NEED MORE CLASSIC THAI MUSIC. Everyone there is very kind and we talk about everything from tattoos, to other thai restaurants where they work to making bracelets and the acrobatic Koi. :)

CONS:
I really just have some ideas on how they could make the dining experience better there. I had mentioned doing live thai music there or doing hand-drawn noodles when you first come in or having a hostess dress up like this: http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2687/4462823519_dd17a12e79.jpg
The only other suggestion I would make would be more specials to keep the daily menu fresh.

CONCLUSION:
Check out the amazing interior design of this amazing restaurant in the heart of Abington just across the street from Kitchen Bar.  Check out the wood sculptures, sit down and have some good thai-vietnamese cuisine. Don't forget the bubble tea and the vietnamese coffee is better then any other coffee you ever had! 
Give it a try and don't forget to see the circus Koi!

My recent obsession being yarn (and therefore knitting and crocheting), and I've been over to Michaels a lot more than I'd like to admit recently. While the products offered here are good, what really brings this Michaels down is its customer service. While I don't expect someone to be overly friendly, I would expect a measure of politeness, which, unfortunately, is a bit lacking here. For instance, today the cashier yelled and snapped at me a good deal about competitor coupons, despite the fact that Michaels advertises accepting them. It was extremely unfriendly and off putting, making me not want to return. 
While I haven't experienced quite as traumatizing experiences during my other visits, I have noted that the customer service is not outstanding here. Not only that, but I believe that AC Moore (which is just down the street) offers better deals with their membership and coupons.

1925394,16,2,h6SHzdjHjbmmKXwPzrHwSw,"My 12 year old son has been going to this location because it is easy to attend.
On this occasion, 2/7/19 he asked to get his hair cut before attending a funeral for his Grandmother. 
He has black hair and had a natural light brown tint on the top of his hair and bangs. This was left over from the summer. He looked really good with it. 
My wife told the person cutting his hair, Rosemary, not to touch the top of his head. This obviously would keep the colors and his bangs long. It is what he wanted and we wanted.
She decided to cut off the hair anyways. Completely removing the light brown tint. She apologized and lied by saying our son told her to. He did not. 
He left crying. She was kind of patronizing syaing it was only a little bit from the top and he looks good. 
So, I learned that my wife paid and tipped. I went back a half hour later and explained we needed our money back. Rosemary just shrugged off that she cut the hair we asked not to be touched. Saying, take a picture of it and show the manager, it looks good. I explained that we were attending a funeral shortly and it has created emotional trauma. Rosemary continued to cop an attitude about it. 
They indicated they could not repay me, only the manager could do that. The manager was not available until the next day.
So I returned the next morning and explained the problem and the emotional trauma. The manager apologized and understood that cutting a small portion of the hair on the top of his head removed the hilight. She said it herself. She returned the money and tip. And indicated she would use it as a ""learning experience"" for her staff person. 
WTH. No you get rid of the person entirely. She is lucky that we wouldn't seek damages. 
Suffice it to say my son will never return to this store or a Great Clips again. Even a week later he is still upset over the lady who cut his hair too short. 
Why would you do that when you were told not to? She made a decision on her own and really did not care what anyone else would think or why a request was made. She knew better in her mind.",l-LfqtfzzkNVDIFPJwuIYw,1.0,2019-02-14 14:11:09,xOr3cP1xO2qC4lx2E9jnBg,0,2019-02-14 14:11:09

Nothing fancy. While I was waiting I even found a picture of the length and the taper that I wanted. So I show ""Rosemary"", get in her chair and it just goes downhill... She starts to cut, walks away to talk to another stylist, comes back and continues. Not long after I asked for a mirror. I had told her due to a cervical spinal surgery last May I could not feel the back of my head. When I look in the mirror I knew I was going to have a terrible panic attack (I do suffer from anxiety). She had cut my hair so short up the back she could have used clippers. My hair is in the shape of a horseshoe! The back is completely butchered up to the top of my head and she left long sides so from the front it looks like a super duper short bob! After having cervical spinal surgery last year they had to cut open the back of my head. There is no way I would get a haircut this short to highlight a scar that runs into my head like that. I was so upset I begged my husband to cancel our trip down the shore. It was only two nights but he had surprised me with a"" you deserve this trip baby, it's been a hard recovery for you"". Being on disability, I cannot afford to cancel a trip like this. I reached out to corporate Great Clips who put me in touch with someone who works with the owner. I told him what happened, I showed them pictures, and all I want is to be refunded for my trip. Not much to ask right? Do you think that's happened? The moral of my story here is do not go here!

1954330,0,4,lsVSUF0R6iZBJuMFJg_3ew,"I was looking for an African American salon in this area and was hoping for an easy and relaxing experience where I'd like the result with my shoulder length hair. I don't want my hair to be over-styled.  As a professional woman who travels quite a bit, I wanted an easy, healthy-looking style with a little volume to give this 50-year old face a little lift.  I need to be able to sleep on a 12 hour flight, get up, brush my hair in an airplane bathroom and keep moving straight into a meeting. 

So many prior salon experiences left me with flat, overly-straight hair with no movement.  I found this spot online and the reviews were good, so I booked an appt. My girlfriends all thought I was insane for trying any hair salon working dozens of personal recommendations. 

The booking process was simple and I quickly received a text confirmation of my appointment and a reminder. I loved that.  I'm busy and a bit scattered - I NEED reminders. This was perfect. 

I arrived, was warmly greeted and was given a quick customer information sheet to complete - along with a price list (thank you!). I was then taken by Brittany to her chair to discuss my hair, my desires and my expectations. Brittany demonstrated professionalism while also being friendly and easy to connect with.  

My hair was shampooed by Kenneth, who gave me the best temple massage. I had to fight to keep from falling  asleep in the shampoo chair. Good conversation. Ultra relaxing.  Comfortable shampoo chairs and a foot stool so you can prop your feet up. The shampoo room is walled off from the rest of the salon, you're getting a very relaxing experience, but there is a glass door, so you can still see what's going on (unless your eyes are closed, as mine were). 

Having really listened to my desire to have a little lift and movement to my hair, Brittany had me sit under the cool dryer for just a few mins and then did the blow dry. But unlike other salons, she didn't snatch my hair bone-straight.  She left it with some volume - then gave me a flat iron and trim. I was all much quicker than I'd expected and I was left with EXACTLY what I wanted. I was shocked - she ""got"" me. Had I brought in a magazine photo for a stylist to replicate, it would have been what I walked out with.  

The salon is comfortable, clean and a no-nonsense place - grown-woman style.  They offered me a glass of wine - the music was nice - and the clientele was friendly and relaxed.  I didn't wait at all, yet they did have plenty of customers.  They kept us all moving. 

I left the salon and met my girlfriends for dinner. Everyone loved my hair.

Adams avenue is not that far, and if you are scared of bad bad Philly, Pho and Beyond, while not Adams avenue quality is close by in Willow Grove and a much better choice.

2218689,1,1,-g9ihRwldmD3j5U5W3P3wg,"At my in-laws' house the past weekend, we were looking for a place for takeout. This is suburbia and few places were still open until 9 p.m. on a Sunday evening. Gummlai Thai fortunately was open and as it had good reviews, we went with it. We ordered our dishes at about 8:40 and were at the restaurant by 9 p.m. for pickup. When we were at the restaurant and found out that there was a 6% discount for paying by cash, we decided to go with that option. Overall, the ordering and pick-up went quite smoothly.

For the four of us - myself and my wife, my father-in-law and my brother-in-law we went with an order of Pad Thai, Dancing Shrimp, Tuti Fruity Duck, and Red Curry with Chicken. I am happy to say that most of these dishes were very good. Thai cuisine is one of my favorite cuisines and Pad Thai and Red Curry are standard go-tos for us and the dishes that we had here were better than at the average Thai restaurant. The only dish that was a disappointment was the Tuti Fruity Duck. The gravy was unseasonably sweet and something that we didn't even end up finishing all of. 

Overall, the portions were more or less reasonable though I would say that portions tend to be a bit larger at the average Thai restaurant. Also the photos can be somewhat misleading, especially as it pertains to the Tuti Fruity Duck. We were more than a little surprised when we found how small the dish actually was.

Overall, I would certainly consider Gummlai Thai if another opportunity presented itself. While I did not experience the service of the staff first hand, the ordering and pickup were flawless - not something that can always be said of restaurants.

The campus is absolutely beautiful. It's spacey, but definitely not too big and intimidating! The only downfall is the parking. Traffic to get to Abington is already horrible enough; add the complications of parking troubles and it can get to be quite the headache. This can be avoided, however, if you come around 8:00AM, 11:00AM, 2:00PM, and any time past 4:00PM. The crazy hours fall somewhere in between those times!

The limited parking is definitely not enough to bump my review down to four stars, though. They offer additional parking less than a mile away at Target, where shuttles pick you up at a set schedule.

In case you're lost:
-Food is located in Lares. The cafeteria is open Monday - Thursday 7:30AM-10:30AM, reopening 11:00AM-6:00PM, and Friday 7:30AM-10:30AM, reopening from 11:00AM-3:00PM. It is closed weekends.
-Bookstore is located in the lower level of Lares.
-Library is in Woodland
-Campus Security (parking passes and lost&found) is in Rydal.
-Athletic building is pretty secluded and located on the opposite side of campus.

Definitely an amazing school with amazing people offering amazing opportunities! It is simply amazing. :)

My boyfriend and I had dinner there on a Friday night about a month ago.  It was our second visit.  This time we were in a hurry so sat on the takeout side.  The sit-down part of the restaurant was surprisingly empty for a Friday night.  

We shared a meatball parm sandwich and fries.  Both were very good.  The problem arose when we got our check.  The bill was higher than I expected.  I studied the bill and saw that they double charged us for my friend's iced tea (I had water).  I pointed it out to the waitress and she argued with me.  I did the very simple math.  Still she argued.  That's the way we do it, she said.  Here, I'll show you these other checks, we charge everybody like that.  Seriously???  I said well I'm not paying $15 when it should be $12.  So she turned us over to the cashier who argued at first but then realized the mistake and said I think it's programmed like that.  I can't believe it.  So in fact that they are stealing from people on a regular basis and never noticed?  

Next I handed her a $20 bill.  She gave me my change.  I barely paid attention and just shoved it in my pocket.  My friend said check the change.  She had given me $2 and change back instead of $7!!!  She shorted me $5.  I called her on it and she gave it to me.  But I left feeling like I'd been robbed.

It's infused with a ton of flavor and has it's own personality when it comes to Asian dishes. And Gummlai Thai, as of last night, became one of my favorite Thai food restaurants. It's located in a cozy and amiable suburban town called Roslyn, adjacent to the more familiarized community of Willow Grove. But don't let the location fool you, because the food here exceeds expectations as it continues to reign for over two years now in a hidden location. 

Starters: Very appetizing.

+Spring rolls were fresh with good sized meat in them. 
+Tom-Yum Soup- A delicious light broth filled with amazing spice and flavors.  Chunks of tomato, mushrooms and chicken.

Entrees: Very Delightful.

+Drunken noodles were sweet and tangy. It's probably one of the best I've ever had. 
+Jungle Jungle with tofu was sauteed in veggie goodness and a sweet and sour sauce like no other. Evidently, my friend (Punjabi) also approved of the spice level.

That its located in my old home town of Roslyn is amazing.  I only hope Roslyn and the surrounding communities help support it.  I've spent a lot of time in Thailand so I should say comparing in country food (especially Asian) to our restaurants is wholly unfair.  It's impossible to get all the proper herbs and ingredients used in country so in all fairness my rating is relative.  But these folks get it close, really close.  If there is a downside, I'd say that the food generally lacks ""heat"".  That is easily remedied by asking for more or less spiciness, just ask.  Not all Thai food is spicy!!!  But many dishes are, so if you know you like the heat, say ""pet ma"" a couple times and soon you'll be breathing fire.

Clean male & female restrooms. We came here for a week night dinner and there was a steady pace of business. There was one waitress for about 20 patrons, and she did not missed a beat. My wife & I tried:

Som Tum (Papaya Salad) - perfect salad with julienned papaya, grape tomatoes, lettuce and thai chili peppers dressed in that distinct spicy, sweet, salty dressing . (I'll give it a 3 on the spice scale - equal to sriracha. Spice scale from 1 (no spice) to 5(habanero)
Chiang Mai Sausage - Northern Thai Sausage with pork & spices. Pleasantly surprised. Was expecting a greasy & salty sausage but was served with a subtle herb-y and spiced sausage. Will definitely try again.
Pad See Ew hit the spot with it's bold ""wok"" flavor (commonly created by using a hot and well-seasoned wok). I can see this as my default dish at Gummlai Thai.
Pineapple Fried Rice - The rice was a little too moist for fried rice but the flavor was acceptable. I probably would not order this again.
Thai Iced Tea - Typically tasty but not a large serving.

Total cost: $40 without gratuity.

They also have a week night dinner special that includes your choice of soup, appetizer and main entree for ~$15. We did not go this route because the salad and sausage was not a choice.

From this visit: a cold draft from the outside mean this is a bad place to visit if you're sensitive and it's freezing out. The appetizer special, grilled calamari over spring mix had more balsamic vinegar than I'd have added but the calamari itself was so good I forgave it anything.

I got the shrimp pad thai (as I always do) and I just found the noodle to be a little dryer than I'm used to.  And judging by the length of the noodles, it appears the noodles were broken during the cooking process - this really irked me. Edible, sure.  But imagine ordering spaghetti and meatballs and the spaghetti noodles were each about an inch long. Experience ruined. 

The food can be made to various spice levels: 1, 2, 3, 4 or Thai, with Thai being the spiciest. I opted for 3, but I really think they must've just forgot, cuz it wasn't spicy at all. I requested a side of spice and the server offered red flakes, which really made a difference and gave it the kick it needed.

With the lunch special, you get a soup and appetizer, and I really did enjoy my Tom yum soup and Thai dumpling, but nothing special or mind blowing.  And broken noodles seems like a rookie mistake.

I tend to like the products TJ Maxx as a chain stocks; it's pretty hit-or-miss, and the prices range from dirt cheap to slightly above what I'd want to pay, often with no clear logic, but that makes shopping here kind of fun.

This particular store wasn't the nicest TJ Maxx I've been in, but I think it's above average.  The location is convenient for car access, and parking is easy.  However, I have to give this location a bit of a critique because I think the plaza that this store is in is a pretty glaring example of sprawl-oriented development.  Rather than contributing to an active commercial district that is pleasant to walk around, this plaza is just a vast expanse of parking lots with a bunch of strip malls and a big target thrown in.

I paid for the upgraded crown to be completely white, which they forced me into basically. Come to find out they didn't give me the upgraded one I paid for. They gave me the free one with silver underneath that my insurance would of covered completely with no out of pocket expense to me. The only reason I found this out is because the silver is now starting to show underneath my gum line. I will be contacting my lawyer also about this. 2. I got a filling last week which they did not let me chose whether it be silver or porcelain,  they just automatically used porcelain which my insurance did not cover. They tell me after the fact when they are billing me. So I called my insurance to explain, then the dental receptionist gets on the phone with them and basically tells them that I am lying to get out of paying the copay. Luckily I have proof that they did not give me a choice of which filling to use because the waiver sheet is not signed. The receptionist tried to force me to sign it after the fact which i told my ins comp so that will be the second complaint filed.

Ordered the Lemon Ricotta pancakes and million dollar bacon for myself. My guests had the Ham and Gruyere Omelet and the Biscuits with Sausage Gravy. The Lemon Ricotta pancakes are really good, the pancake is a multigrain batter but it tastes like a typical good pancake. I enjoyed them, I wouldn't get them again because I'm a basic pancake person but I wanted to be adventurous on the first day of the new year and I was pleasantly surprised. They serve warm syrup which is key to having good pancakes. There is a extra charge for real maple syrup but I found the syrup they serve to be just fine. 

Now onto the million dollar bacon, let me preface this by saying I've had million dollar bacon from a place in San Francisco that is supposedly very well known for this bacon. I've had it there and didn't like it because the flavor balance was very off. Now First Watch's Million Dollar bacon was way better, the flavors were a perfect balance between sweet, spicy, and salty.  Its definitely worth a try and I would get again. Now onto the other entrees in my party. The omelette was good per my son but the potatoes were a little undercooked and lukewarm. Not a big deal but they missed the mark on them. The biscuits and sausage lacked in flavor and sausage. It was mostly under seasoned gravy over biscuits. It just needs a little more seasoning and sausage to make it a worthy dish.

The wait was relatively short and they will seat you within 5 minutes of you getting there. The menu is simple and short as well. 

I wasn't exactly blown away by the food but it is very heavy and filling (it's a good thing; you get the most bang for your buck if you are hungry). I got the chikinchanga and my friend got biscuits as gravy. 

The chikinchanga was good; Mexican style burrito with healthy ingredients. I love how they have chunks of avocado. I got to taste my friends dish as well; I personally like my gravy thicker and creamy. The gravy is more like grits; personally I didn't like the texture but, to each his own. 

The biggest thing was the potatos were super salty; ask for less seasoning or on the side. The water also was very... Tap tasting... My friend lives in Abington and he said it tasted very funny.

We were seated promptly, but it took awhile for our waitress to get our drinks. We put an order in for calamari and it was excellent. My dining companions ordered chicken parm, and I had the clams and linguine in white sauce. The food came in a decent amount of time. I think the presentation and flavor left a lot to be desired. My companions liked the flavor of the chicken parm, but I felt like it was missing a sprinkle of parsley on top (they melted the cheese on the chicken parm, but didn't sprinkle any garnish on it). It was just melted cheese on top. My friends did mention they felt there wasn't enough sauce on the dish either. I felt that my clams and linguine dish lacked a lot of flavor. It was bland. They give a generous amount of pasta and clams, but again it was lacking in flavor. While we were dining, there was a private event going on, and that took a lot of our waitresses attention away from from our table. She offered refills on our soda, but forgot about it until we were basically done our entrees. For dessert we had the dark side of the moon cake, which was delicious.

The regular 8"" sub isn't packed with meat as stated in other reviews but is just the right amount for me and for $5.29 you can't beat it. If you want a fatter sub get the giant club sandwich. It isn't really a club sandwich but just a fuller sub with a lot more meat and that's only $6.79. The rolls are baked fresh there and is very good. You can also get it on their fresh baked thick 7 grain bread but I haven't tried that. They also gut the roll unless you ask them not to. Bottom line, great prices and great sandwiches. I recommend giving it a try.",-lM78iJEh0GH5MkgE-_u5g,5.0,2016-10-11 22:46:26,9Dpx8E0SHMf-WIcybVMlGw,0,2016-10-11 22:46:26

I work as a sever as well, so I hate to write this review but we're didn't meet our server until he dropped the check... yep! Crazy right, never in my life. 

I used the app to get a table, so we skipped the wait and our table was ready when we walked in. We sat right away which was great! But after 20 Minutes of sitting there (not an exaggeration) with no one coming up to us, and people walking past with no one stoping, the table next to us sat and had service, water and coffee right away, my boyfriend was getting pretty agitated. I went to the hostess and asked if we did indeed have a server... the women said ""that's Malik's table"" she sent a woman over right away to take our order.    We had been ready to order for some time, so we placed the order right away and she brought over our drinks and we never saw a server again. No refills were offered, no one asked us how the food was or even if everything came out okay. About 10 minutes after we were done eating a man comes up and asks us if we're done, finally Malik shows up and puts a check on the table.  And we pay right away so my boyfriend doesn't freak out about the terrible service. 

A few other nitpicking things. Our avocado was so hard it had the consistency of a raw potato. 
The table we were facing remained dirty and wasn't  bussed for 45 minutes!!! with a wait.

Maybe some more traditional artificial sweeteners might have helped.  For a $13.00 breakfast ( which is $6.75 down the road at Joey Tates), a decent cup of coffee isnt a lot to ask for.

Wait Time: During my first visit, there was little wait because it wasn't busy. Today, we were told 20-30 minute to wait for a table for 3. The wait was probably 15 minutes, which was reasonable. The issue I have with the wait is that there were at least 5 tables that were unbussed during the entirety of my visit, which was over 90 minutes. At one point, there were 10 tables open, some clean, some not. There was also about 20+ people waiting. 

Service: My party had to ask for silverware each time. Today, we asked two times for the silverware and never received it. My husband ultimately got up and asked the host for silverware. The food took forever to come out. We waited at least as hour for our food to come out and they did not come out together. There was 15 minutes between the first dish coming out and the remainder of the dishes being brought to the table.

Juices: Pretty good and fresh. They are a little sweeter than I'd prefer, but still tasty.

Food/Price: Food is good. I've tried the market skillet, turkey sausage gravy and biscuits, million dollar bacon, and lemon ricotta pancakes. All were tasty, however seems to be overpriced for the food and not worth the extended wait for the food.

So, this warehouse appears to be smaller than others in the region, but the inventory seemed about the same.  If you have patience, and enjoy the sport of bargain hunting, this could be one of your stake out safaris. 

Word of caution. Don't trust the sizes/prices posted on the store-attached tags.  They are often wrong.

2527085,0,4,Pr5uwMUWCdq6kkK0OGDg7Q,"SO, I would have liked to give First Watch 5 stars, but our service was THAT bad I can't give more than 1 star. I had previously came here when they first opened and had a pleasant experience so I expected to have a similar experience. 

Before arriving I added myself to the waitlist through Yelp. I was super happy with this service as we arrived and only had to wait about 5-7 mins for a table to be ready and we were seated. We had a party of 3 adults and 2 children(in high chairs). The front desk staff was super friendly and inviting! Up until this point things were going great!

Then, we got to our table and a employee dropped off some coffee for our table. Next, our waitress ""Kiki"" arrived unpleasantly and asked if we were ready to order our food... there was no greeting- no good morning- how are you-- NOTHING. We advised her we were not ready and she began walking away. I had to ask her to take our drink order.... seems a little crazy to me that a waitress would come up to a table and not ask if they could get them anything to drink!? Especially when there are two young children at the table... So as our dining experience  continued so did the horrible service. 

She did not check on us in between taking our food order and drink order to see if we needed refills or anything else. Our food arrives.. or should I say 80% of the food arrived and we did not have enough silverware. Trying to track her down to ask for another set was ROUGH! Once we got the silverware she ignored the fact that one entire order of food was MIA and everyone else was well Into their meal. Again, there was no checking to see if we needed anything or needed refills (which is clear to see we did as our glasses were EMPTY)!!!!! 

Every time we asked for something (refill, napkins, silverware etc.) it seemed we were inconveniencing her. .. which is IRONIC since it's her job -- The entire experience was tainted due to the poor service!

Lastly, the waitress at one point came up to our table and started touching and playing with my one friend's child's toy!!! She didn't ask, she just grabbed it and started messing with it... I don't know how anyone thinks it's okay to touch someone's child's toy. Kids are always putting things  in their mouths and both of my friends are very  conscientious of germs and not having people touch their children's things without freshly washed hands. It's poor etiquette and inappropriate for a waitress to do this. But this was the first time she approached our table and actually smiled. 

In regards to the actual food, everything came out hot and really tasty (just not timely or even together!!).

Time for the negatives after already almost a 3 week stay and no where near the finish line. They charge $10 A DAY for TV access! Fine if you're in for a few days but our TV bill would be close to $700 by the time she gets out. What a ripoff. Almost every hospital includes TV for free. They gave her the excuse that they just upgraded the system but in reading past reviews they've always charged $10 a day. 

The parking situation. I know, no one wants to pay for parking but parking garages are a necessary evil. Again, understandable but what is not ok is their pricing. $7.50 of you're there 3 hours. And they do a pretty pitiful discount if you're loved one is in for a longer stay, after so many weeks you can buy a 2 week parking pass for $10.

2543082,0,10,FalZsKfOk1Tk2p268XAQ6A,"Last week I made the unfortunate decision to go to the ER instead of my Doctor because I was running a high fever.  I was first greeted by the metal detector run by two not so chipper security guards.  My next stop was to the much less than friendly or compassionate triage.  Then I was led at a quick pace to their top of the line room in the 400 section. 

 I had my own TV, bathroom, and a door that actually closed.  The not so top of the line part was the gurney that I ended up spending many many hours on.  The only thing they put on it was a small sheet that did not cover the entire mattress.  Most of the time I was laying on the plastic because the sheet kept shifting every time I moved.

The fun really started when they tried to get my blood.  It took at least 6 tries from three different people, one of which was being ""trained"".

After 8 hours, I was finally sent home with antibiotics.

It get better...
At 6am the next morning I got a call from an ER doctor telling me that I needed to come back because some of my blood work came back showing a much more serious issue. 

So, once again, same metal detector.  Different triage but same bad treatment.  No top of the line room this time but same poorly made gurney,  More attempts to get blood.  It took 8 hours for them to get me to a room.

The food was conmpletely awful and they have the nerve to charge $10 for the TV.  That is unless you don't mind QVC or Christian preaching channels.

Turned out the original blood work was cross contaminated, probably from the plastic mattress. The retest was clean.  Even so, they did not want me to leave.  They wanted me to stay the weekend and beyond to get a bunch of IV's and tests that I did not need. It was only after I made it clear that I was walking out that they finally discharged me.

All the nursing staff and PAs were wonderful.  The doctors were awful.  They all gave me inconsistent information and it was clear that the residents did not consult with my chart or each other.",mQZpnPY7o2u3I90rbzZNQg,1.0,2017-06-29 20:37:51,cgYaOtdWRXEj4V9YbwjWGQ,0,2017-06-29 20:37:51

They just looked in his ear, said it was red, prescribed amoxicillin. I told him that there was another child in the house who was recovering from hand foot and mouth disease and I think he may have that and they did not listen. He also did have red sores on his palms and legs and mouth.
I did question the doctor again however because for an ear that just ""looked a little red inside"", the extreme pain that my son was in including the incredibly bad fever just did not match a ""red-ear that just wasn't that infected""... it just didn't match up to me. I took him to Einstein the next day and their diagnosis was he did not have an ear infection just had a sore throat and I got even worse service there. Legit, it looked like he has 2 rasperroes for tonsils and ulcers in his mouth.

When we drove up to the trauma center we were met by parking valets which was a foreign concept to me as I had not driven to the ER before but it was convenient and removed some stress around getting admitted and dealing with the car. Humorously I was in the backseat with my semiconscious mother and the valet was about to park us all at first but then assisted in getting a wheelchair and getting her treated. So the valets were good and the service is free for those having medical emergencies and we showed our appreciation by tipping when they retrieved our car so we could leave.  
Nobody in my family had any idea why my mom was in such a state and she could not communicate so we had to go through a long series of blood draws and tests while my mom was thrashing around an unable to speak.  
The staff were empathetic ,professional and patient, eventually recommending soft restraints for her after she repeatedly ripped out electrodes and pulled off her hospital gowns. 
It was a long night with three separate car scans taken because she was struggling so hard to get comfortable. 
My mother suffers from a condition called trigeminal neuralgia which causes intense pain prevents her from functioning in anyway, and while she appeared to be in pain we were on sure if maybe she had suffered from a stroke or some brain injury. 
When finally she was admitted to the hospital after ruling out any life-threatening conditions we were told by the nursing staff to that the visiting hours were flexible and we could visit with her as long as we wanted, anytime we wanted. That was also a new concept to me as almost all of our families hospital experience revolved around strict visiting hours. 
Because of her pain level at inability to communicate we determined that we would split each day and make sure someone familiar was with her at all times. She gradually report regained consciousness the next day with my brother and niece in the room. 
The hospital kept her for two more days and ran a battery of test and closely monitored and medications almost to a fault of times but as necessary to make sure that there were no further toxic reactions. 
Of course there were inconvenient moments when medications had to be administered, or when a nurse would get  called into another patient before completing a request but overall everyone was pretty responsive, very respectful and friendly. And because there was always a family member with her, we were able to help her to the bathroom assist with cleanup etc in a way that we might not have been able to do at other hospitals. 
The only real downside is that you have to pay for parking (for visitors  not emergency patients) in the hospital a lot which seemed unusual to me but might just be the way it is everywhere. With us swapping out every few hours to keep her company, the hospital made a good bit on our parking.

During our first visit the ICU nurse came in and didn't even acknowledge that we were there - didn't even look up at us. Upon discharge the nurse wouldn't even get him a wheelchair to the car (is this even allowed?!) and appeared annoyed when we asked and told us we would have to wait an hour so we'd be better off doing it ourselves. Considering he was just in the ICU and would need PHysical therapy to regain strength and was on oxygen, I'm thinking it wasn't the smartest choice to have that patient walk to the car....

His care at St.Mary's has been far better and they are monitoring him daily to make sure he is strong enough to get back to his routine - not just rushing him out. His nurses are informative and show support to the family and have been very pleasant to work with. And you don't have to pay out your rear end for visitor parking - an added plus! We've also have great experiences with Holy Redeemer as well.

I was shocked upon arrival by ambulance that the ER doctors insisted my fiance was a herione overdose no matter what I said, instead of checking his blood they pumped his stomach and gave him two shots or Narcan.....needless to say it didn't work. Eventually they were forced to intubate him while texting, and then spend almost and hour and several nurses to secure veins for IVs. After he was finally moved from that horror story he was put in the MICU. The staff never once addressed him or explained what they were doing or why, they simply treated him like a vegetable. After awhile he began to try to move his hands in gestures to convey his wants and needs, at this point he was given a sedative for being ""combative"". Over two more days I watched several stafstaff repeat that technique everyone he tried to communicate, he finally gave up attempts and would only respond to me when we were alone. The nursing supervisor found this out tonight  and forces me to leave the hospital, after of course giving him yet another IV sedative. I guess Abingtons nurses are moving back to the era of Thorazine. Their lack of compassion, bed side manner, and knowledge of patient care is allarming in the Lenfast Building.

Also, two or three times now when I have had billable things not covered by insurance, there's been a positive balance in my account.

2594461,4,13,gcCmLuUqMMFU9yk12p15fg,"RN: Female Nurse. Approx 5'3"" 3/4. Her name is Azhir/Azheer/Azeer* check spelling

My review is NOT towards the hospital itself, but for the nurse who attended to me and I use the verb, attended, very loosely.

From the beginning to end, my nurse, (Azheer* check spelling) was exceptionally RUDE to me. My first interaction with her, was with a pill shoved in my face!
1. She did NOT introduce herself, as my nurse for my stay.
2. She did NOT introduce the pill she was giving me, to take. She held it out, in her hand, and told me to ""take it for pain.""
3. She did not offer me a warm blanket, during my whole stay in the ER.
4.  Also, when she left my room, she left the room curtains wide open! She left the curtains open!! I felt exposed! She left me without any coverings, and I did not see her again, until it was time for me to be discharged
5. There was a period where I was going to the bathroom, and she open the cabinet, in my room,  took out a pair of socks, and threw them on the bed. She did not offer to help me put them on.
6. And to add more insult to injury, I thought she was finally being compassionate towards me when she said, ""if I'm feeling dizzy that I should not go to the bathroom."" But then she continued to explain that ""if I fall, that she would get into trouble."" That made me want to cry, because she didn't care whether or not I would get hurt. Her only concern was that she would get in trouble if I fell. 

I felt like dirt. I felt like she didn't want me there. I felt like I was a burden to her. I felt like I wasn't as valuable as her other patients, which proved evident later on in this complaint.

Her facial demeanor... her tone of voice with me... her body language...she made me feel unwanted and unworthy of her care. I have never experienced such rudness and coldness from the medical staff at Abington Memorial Hospital, ED. I have felt MORE worse with her being my nurse, then I did the pain that brought me to the ER!

All of this proved to be evident, because as I was being discharged, I heard a nurse in the room next to me; room 415. This voice was a voice of compassion. A very angelic voice. A voice of empathy. It was soft, inviting, and sweet. A voice of encouragement. This voice asked the patient, in room 415, if ""she wanted a blanket"", and told her ""I would get you two warm blankets."" This voice demanded to know who left the bedpan under the patient for x amount of time.  This voice went over and Beyond to make sure that the patient, in room 415, was comfortable, using words and phrases such as ""you will be ok honey"", and ""don't worry"", and ""I am so sorry I will take care of this"", and so on. I'm listening to this sweet nurse, wishing that she was my nurse. But, this voice...when this voice walked out of room 415, to my surprise it was the nurse who was attending to me! I couldn't believe it! It was then that confirmed that not only did my nurse, Azheer, have the ability to be compassionate towards me, it confirmed that she PURPOSELY was not!

**Other important details about my stay with nurse Azheer,
1. Not once did she come to me when my call Bell was on. I had other nurses and CNAs that attended to me.
2. When I was asked, by CNA, to provide a urine sample, my nurse, Azheer, did not help me out of the bed. She knew of my pain level, and never offered to help put the hospital socks on my feet.
3. Pill incident: I said to her, what is this? Her response both facial and verbal expressions were uninviting. She did tell me what it was, but when I told her I wasn't familiar with it and ask why can't I just receive ibuprofen, she exhaled and rolled her eyes and looked at the Dr. with disgust. She didn't realize I saw her. By her not sharing with the Physician why I was hesitant, to take the pill, she inadvertently perceived me to be a ""trouble/difficult patient.""
4. When I was being discharged, her tone was very rude and dismissive. I was very dizzy, nauseous, and in pain. She knew that I was given morphine. She showed zero empathy of how I might be feeling and that I need her to slow down when she was speaking to me not that she said much. To add more insult, I asked her if I may have a note to return to work. She said to me, ""Why didn't you ask the doctor for a note""? I told the nurse that I forgot to ask. Her demeanor, once again, was very clear that I was a bother to her. 

As I was checking out, I asked to speak to the charge nurse, Elizabeth. I shared all of this with her. Elizabeth showed compassion/concern for what took place and assured me that she will speak with, nurse Azheer. She apologized on her behalf and asked me if there's anything that I needed. The charge nurse, Elizabeth was great. Very professional and compassionate. I do hope that nurse Azheer receives reprimanding and training, when working with all demographics. I am immensely and genuinely hurt by Nurse Azheer's interactions with me today.",mQZpnPY7o2u3I90rbzZNQg,1.0,2019-07-28 18:53:31,U90WhiZi7uX8MLgRUp560Q,0,2019-07-28 18:53:31

2606350,1,0,rDfCPXVhrjs5pp-mC8ZA1w,"Went on a Wednesday night with a local family (we're from Colorado).
Despite the bank-like exterior, our companions called it a diamond in the rough. Our friends specifically seek out NYC Little Italy restraunts like Amici II and Benito I/II for the flavor, presentation, and recipes, and drive several hours north just for them, and they really enjoy this place. So it is safe to say that if you like NYC Italian, you'll love this restaurant - there are many similarities.

Positives: 
-moderately priced
-menu with many options, served with beautiful presentation.
(the mozzarella w/tomatoes was amazing - delicate and nuanced flavor, freshness, and texture - no homoginized or watered-down stuff, here)
-lovingly furnished, upscale decor
-wonderful service - attentive, well -seasoned waitstaff 
(with his NY accent, and tall, dark look, our server favorably reminded me of a modern-day Groucho Marx, including all of his gracious, hospitable, charming ways, which was just as appreciated as the meal!)
-BYOB was great for our group who happen to be particular about their drink choices, so they brought their own beer and wine - our server happily stored, poured, and then returned undrank items when we left, smoothly, without a hiccup in dining experience.

Also observed: 
- a lovely separate area for a group, a Sunday outing, or bringing someone special out to a birthday lunch with a bigger-than-usual crowd
- entrance is wheelchair safe and accessable
- takeout/pizza buisness was steady, even on a wed night

Rivera D'Italia seems to be trying to offer several options to this mixed-needs neighborhood (takeout, fine dining, group dining) - and seems to be up to the task.
Particularly outstanding is the Italian dinner experience - it is a great place for a date, a celebratory meal w/dessert, or simply an above-the-norm night of Italian flavors, atmosphere, food preparation, and presentation.",ntsN09UfQSlRWO37guMKMw,4.0,2018-08-19 05:37:53,X6Qc1X8GOGjI4f-Po160Ug,3,2018-08-19 05:37:53

2615484,2,11,vRfODjquRhNh9VWpA-i8lA,"This place is a nightmare. I chose this place because I recently moved to the area and read great reviews.( I'm sure they are all paid for.) The women at the front desk are awesome. They deserve a better place. All of them.

 The woman who originally cleaned my teeth was atrocious. My teeth never hurt so much while getting a cleaning! She took X-rays and forgot to put the X-ray machine in front my my face. It was in the corner. She actually said ""why isn't the X-ray coming up on the screen?"" to which I replied ""the X-ray machine is in the corner."" She laughed at this and I shook my head.

The dentist did a check up and continued to tell me how I need to start brushing and flossing. During the one and only procedure, a crown procedure, he kept telling me to open my mouth wider, however that is not possible because my jaw isn't that big. My last dentist not only understood this but allowed my jaw breaks in between working.

In more than a few moments, he yanked on my jaw to open it wider. The experience was scary and awful. They don't allow you to catch a break or vacuum the water out of your mouth so at times I felt I was drowning. He even mentioned ""I know we're torturing you."" in a joking matter. I told them to stop and wiped tears out my eyes. I said that I felt like I was drowning (I did) and he turned it around to say that this procedure is the kind that always ""messes up the women's makeup."" He completely disregarded the pain. I've had a crown fitted before and it was NOT difficult and I was taken care of and made to feel safe. 

After the experience and the novicane  wore off I had FOUR days of slight migraines and it was painful to eat. This lasted four days and then it was okay however difficult to eat.

As I write this review I am in my crown fitting appointment. The temporary crown needs to come out so they can put in the real one. Their assistant tried to yank it out of my mouth. It felt like she was pulling out a tooth. After pulling and yanking assuring me that ""...it's going to be a little painful."" I asked her to stop. The pain was too much. The temporary crown is still in my mouth.  

I have had a crown before and pulling it out was effortless. I have honestly never felt so scared and unsure about being in the dentists chair.

Perhaps you will have a different experience but I would not recommend this place. Unless you like pain. 

Overall, I would not recommend this practice to someone I loved...or even liked...

Good luck.",t2FKLTPNOrDLMS39RLk9Tw,1.0,2015-04-22 17:04:38,ewnvcNeGp9HKAcOCEQBB2Q,2,2015-04-22 17:04:38

We love Thai and thought we had found our #1 and #2 favorites, in NYC yes, NJ and PA (outside of Center City Philly) has been more challenging until now.  

It was mid-day and we were at Willow Grove mall and found Gummlai on a Yelp Search, they have a special lunch menu, a great way to experience a new restaurant find.

A quiet looking but welcoming exterior that brings you into a lovely designed restaurant sweeping you away during your meal to another place.  Our host/server is family too and she was just so delightful. 

We ordered from the lunch special menu, a wide assortment of lovely sounding dishes.  We both started off with the Tom Kah ( coconut soup): Chicken with coconut milk and lemongrass, galanga which had just the right amount of spice.  A nice soothing flavor on a mild temp day. 

 Next, we shared both Porpia Tod: Thai spring rolls with ground chicken and the Veggie Rolls: Thai spring rolls with mixed vegetable.  Both very unique in flavor and so delicate and fresh with dipping sauces.  

Next, I had the Pad Eggplants * A choice of meat with sweet Thai eggplants sautéed until golden brown and braised with chicken, bell peppers onion, fresh basil and aromatic herbs-- excellent flavor.  So fresh. I selected with the shrimps and boy I'm glad I did, best shrimps I've had in an Asian/Indian type dish.... so fresh, delicate, clean and butterflied.

After that we waited what seemed like forever for our food.  I see that other Yelp reviewers have had the same experience.  On top of that the food at this location was not nearly as good as I have had at other First Watches.  My side of bacon was not warm.  The avocado in my Bacado still had the skin on it.

2644896,0,7,MvRG9Xrr_kS1BBf7wvJ83A,"The worst customer service experience EVER at a doctor's office! I waited for months to see Dr. Jonathan Slusser at Abington Hospital in Lansdale (125 Campus Drive, Suite 220) for a follow-up diabetes appointment and to discuss recent blood lab results. I rushed out of work at 2:20pm to make a 2:45 appointment (the commute was about 25 minutes). When I arrived at the address provided (keep in mind this is the very first time I scheduled a visit at this location - the doctor also has a location in Willow Grove), I came to the main entrance to Abington Hospital along with several other buildings. I was completely unfamiliar with the layout and had to navigate for about 5 minutes until I was able to locate the correct building. Keep in mind that no one at the doctor's office considered mentioning how to find the building once I arrived at Abington Hospital given this was my first appointment at this new location. I parked and ran to the doctor's suite as fast as possible. I arrived at 2:54pm, 9 minutes past my scheduled appointment. The receptionist told me that Dr. Slusser has a 10 minute late policy (which by the way I had not passed), and that he had taken a patient who was early for their 3pm appointment ahead of me, and here's the kicker - she told me I could reschedule for another time or wait 30 minutes to be seen. You've got to be kidding me! How rude and inconsiderate! I was infuriated. I told the receptionist I would be finding another doctor, and to my surprise, there was no response and no attempt to stop me from walking out the door. Instead of giving me the courtesy I deserved (after years of visiting this practice with Dr. Slusser's predecessor, Dr. Gkonos), he and his staff essentially communicated ""f-you"" and let me walk right out the door. My insurance money will be going to a new endocrinologist. Beware!",mQZpnPY7o2u3I90rbzZNQg,1.0,2018-11-08 20:51:29,OwSKDGL1PBaFzE7TBoAZ6g,0,2018-11-08 20:51:29

Overall had a lovely experience.  We clearly focused on trying different dishes this trip.

We were shown our table upon arriving, menus and an ice bucket and water were brought right over. We discussed a few menu items ensuring they could adjust the spice levels.  Spicy foods no longer agree with us, unfortunately :(  but we don't want to miss out on flavor.

We started with the Thai Dumplings, asked for steams vs fried crispy, each dumpling is filled with ground pork, bamboo, and black mushrooms.  A nice mix, good flavor, however, we felt that mix was too tightly packed and felt heavy.  We love light, delicate Thai food selections.

Next, we had the crispy puff which was quite nice, light and fluffy.

For our entree's my wife had the Mussaman with chicken, nice think pieces of white meat chicken with veggies in a very light, tasty broth like curry sauce.

I had the Talay Tong- a mix of seafood (muscles, squid, shrimp,  in a nice light flavorful sauce.  The presentation was a work of plating presentation art.  

Fab night, great tasty food, all fresh colorful ingredients.
Angie was awesome.

2653190,0,3,JfAYzrHuwroJgJLxIiLvfA,"Today my boyfriend and I dined in the restaurant for I believe our 5th or 6th time. Every time we go in the staff is so amazingly kind and and busting their butts. I have brought my sister and cousins here and they love it as well. Our food is always hot and delicious, and the wait times to me seem very normal for a crazy Sunday brunch where the line is out the door. 

However, when my boyfriend and I dined in today, service was great and the food yummy, but like at every restaurant, a group of middle aged ladies were ripping into the manager for the wait time. For literally ten minutes in the middle of the restaurant. Listen if you are going to go to a newly opened breakfast place at 12 on a Sunday....get a grip. It's not gonna take two minutes for your food and the wait wasn't even long. Don't go out to eat at peak times and expect your server to be able to wait on you hand and foot. And secondly, don't constantly make a scene in the middle of the restaurant where others are enjoying their meal because your first world problems are soooooo much bigger than anyone else's. It's rude. If your ten minute wait for eggs is ruining your day, just don't leave your house. They basically got their meal comped and still complained. Get. A. Life.

Also to the person who left a one star review today because the wait time? Seriously? Again. Sunday brunch. It's going to be busy. The way it works is if the staff seats everyone at the door at them same time, then 30 tickets go to kitchen at the same time and mass chaos ensues. That's why there are empty tables. There's a pattern and ebb and flow that restaurants need to follow to keep current tables happy and new tables happy. How about you actually try the places food before you review? How can you people all be so petty?

Basically what I came here to say is that everyone is entitled to their opinion. But no one is entitled to treat human beings like trash. The food is great. The atmosphere is fantastic. The staff is incredible. Sunday brunch is busy. 

So to the staff of First Watch. You go guys. Don't let those middle aged biddies get you down.

To the stocky flamboyant man who works here? You have literally made my day at times when I have come here.

To the blonde server with the messy bun - you were our first server here and you were so above and beyond for us.

To the young, pretty African american server who served us today? You were awesome! 

To the poor server who had the table of ""can speak to manager"" loonies: screwwwww them you are perfect.

To the poor damn manager who I watched be belittled and yelled in his face and have a hand in his face from those crazies as he just apologized and did all he could? Yeah the whole restaurant was on your side. Your job is so hard. I can't believe how in your face that woman was and you handled it with class.

Only downfall, a little pricey. I understand the cost because the food is quality. But offering specials, at least on occasion would be nice.

We waited for about 30 minutes. We ordered and things went kooky from there. My sausage was brought out before any of our food. Like 10-15 minutes before and only half of it was hot. We ate it because we were hungry and didn't want it to get colder so I didn't get to enjoy it with the rest of my meal. A bit later our food arrived except for my son's which they said would be right out. He was very upset when his food didn't come for another 15 or so minutes. My husband's sausage gravy and biscuits was cold and he sent it back. They seemed to put it back in the regular queue because he didn't get it back for another 15 or so minutes. He did enjoy it when it was hot. They need to get things together like bringing side dishes with the actual meal and making sure food is hot. Our waitress did get a discount on our check for us so we decided to give them another shot. Take 2- went today just me and hubby. My sausage came out with my pancake this time but was cold again. Sent it back and it took 10-15 minutes to get new sausage which my husband thinks was nuked. My pancake was delicious. He enjoyed his omelet. Just not sure that we will dine here again.

During my visits there, I've had the drunken noodle and the pad thai. Drunken noodle is my favorite Thai dish, and GT really does it well. I wish I could say the same for the pad thai. It was rather bland, and I had to add a lot of lime juice to bring out the flavors. My wife has had some of the curries, and enjoyed them all.

The restaurant is small, but I am impressed by the way they utilize the space. The tables are close together, but it never feels crowded. The décor is stylish, and the ambiance quiet and relaxing. It is always very clean, too, which I like. Service is always great.

2700744,1,8,x8Q8MMu1TYL4ntasdpgqaQ,"Over the past 4 months, between myself and my husband, we've had three opportunities to personally be admitted and treated in Abington, Memorial Hospital.  If I was writing this review in April, you'd see 5 STARS and the most glowing report I could possibly give this hospital; the nurses; every staff member; and our doctors and my surgeon!  At that time, we had each had an admission, treatment and discharge from Abington. In fact, I was admitted fives days after he was discharged. There aren't praises high enough to bestow on this hospital... UP THROUGH APRIL, 2015.  

But something happened in the interim.  Abington Hospital merged with Jefferson Hospital.  We were so looking forward to this joint venture... one great would hospital would now become one phenomenal hospital! 

Wow... were we ever wrong to assume this would be a change for the better. To say we had ""problems"" there would be such an understatement, it;s not funny... SERIOUSLY NOT FUNNY. 
No, ""problems"" doesn't cover it.  Abington/Jefferson up that level to DISASTERS!!  First of all, we learned that our primary care physician no longer attends at this hospital. This was the reason we chose him... so that when we go into the hospital, we have a doctor who knows us and our history.  My husband was admitted 3 weeks ago for pneumonia -- August 2015. They never once got his medications right, even with a detailed, typed and formatted page of Drug Names; Dosages; and times taken handed to them in ER. Along with that med list, they were handed an as-detailed list of every single doctor and specialist who knows my husband's history and health issues intimately, and could most likely give a detail summary of them off the top of their heads.  Unfortunately, not one of them was called or consulted. Not only that, but it I myself hadn't informed those doctors and specialists that he was admitted to Abington-Now-Merged-With-Jefferspn-Hospital, they never would have known it.  (So, don't be misled into any false sense of security when Abington-Now-Merged-With-Jefferspn-Hospital asks you  to fill out the names of your personal doctors that know you so well. It's an exercise in futility that will get no more attention than if it had gone directly into the circular file.)

In fact, I suspected they were discharging my husband way too soon, before his pneumonia was cleared up enough to go home.  I hate to say, ""I told you so,"" but... 

It took about two weeks, then this past Friday, September 4th, I knew something was very wrong. I Had my husband take his pulse ox level here at home.  It was only 57!  (Just to make sure our pulse oximeter wasn't malfunctioning, I took my pwn pulse ox level.  It was 99.)  

Because Abington-Now-Merged-With-Jefferson-Hospital had discharged him too soon, and, according to our Infectious Disease specialist, put him on only 5 days of an oral antibiotic at home... an antibiotic that was going to be totally useless no matter how long they prescribed it for... his pneumonia has now resurfaced with a vengeance far worse, and he's been admitted to a hospital... again.  

But I can ASSURE you, we didn't take him to Abington-Now-Merged-With-Jefferson-Hospital this time. And unless we suffer some sort of medical crisis within the immediate vicinity of Abington-Now-Merged-With-Jefferson-Hospital someday, and an ambulance insists they're taking us there come hell or high water, we have no intention of EVER setting foot in that (what has now become a) death trap again.  (Although, if it came down to a battle of Who's the Worst Hospital Death Trap between Abington-Now-Merged-With-Jefferson-Hospital and St. Mary's Medical Center in Langhorne, St. Mary's would still take that ""prize."")

2706723,1,1,DZ3ghZ8hWV_dfDYSEIJBrA,"So decided to try some Thai food and we looked up a few suggestions on Yelp and decided to try Gummlai Thai. The place is tucked away in Abington and parking was in the back from what I can tell but anyways we parked in the back because the front street parking said 1 hour parking. Anyways after coming in on a Thursday night was very surprised on how small the place was! There is maybe and I'm being honest 10-12 tables maybe. So anyhow that kind of took me by surprise and the place was pretty dead with just one trio of people eating when we got there at around 6pm. The place did constantly have people coming in for pick up orders so they apparently get a lot of pick up orders from what I saw. So anyhow we were greeted and sat down as the waitress handed out our menus and my wife and I finally decided on what to get. We decided to opt out for the dinner specials which included one order of soup, 2 pieces of an appetizer dish, and one entree for $18.95. I got the Massaman Curry while my wife got the Pineapple Fried Rice and we also got the golden tea bags as an additional separate appetizer. So overall the presentation of our food was nice and the flavors were pretty good as well, it was just kind of small and nothing really spectacular, the sauce for the appetizer was great but the overall flavor of the food was very typical Thai standard. I also thought the beef was kind of tough and stringy but it was alright, there was just nothing outstanding which would constitute me to be like wow I gotta try this again. So with that being said, I gave the place 3 stars for the service and flavor of the dishes as well as the portions size relative to the price. I thought this Thai place would be our new place but after tonight I will search elsewhere, I guess we moved to Philadelphia coming from Atlanta GA which has probably the best Thai food in the country and we are kind of setting high standards based on what we have been accustomed too.

2731545,0,6,4W4envjMYJ44XQ3f-Bs8Jw,"I don't usually write reviews but I thought I should to help others who may be considering going here. The one star is because our Pulmonologist - Dr. Patel and some of our ICU nurses were amazing - besides that our experience was horrible. My father was there for difficulty breathing - the pulmonologist helped us in resolving this issue. Once my father was out of his care there were incompetent residents who were experimenting with my father. Particularly at night there are residents who are not supervised, lack adequate knowledge and do not call their Attending prior to taking action under serious conditions. While my father was in excruciating pain the ICU resident moved him to 6 Berger without even checking what could be wrong even after knowing he was having a bleed previously. Once arriving at 6 Berger and expressing to the nurses that he was in pain the one nurse said my father was ""confused"". After pushing for 3 days they finally looked into it (took a CT scan) and found he had a bleed and moved him back to ICU. His hemoglobin was fluctuating but no one did any further tests to see if there were any other bleeds until we as a family pushed on the issue. Eventually he was moved back to 6 Berger again and with his very swollen feet and fluctuating Hemoglobin he was sent him by the nurse the doctor did not even come to speak with us and explain anything after waiting for 7 hours. Friday he was discharged and Sunday he vomited blood 12 times before I decided to take him to Holy Redeemer where they had multiple specialists come see him and understood he had an ulcer which they are now helping us resolve and if stable, will be moving him to in-patient therapy (which Abington should have referred us considering he was admitted there for a month). Overall, if you're going here be cautious that they have tons of incompetent residents that refuse to reach out to their Attending and therefore do not take the right actions. If you are in the hands of Dr. Patel you are in good hands besides that - the various doctors I have dealt with were not good experiences. I was the one suggesting what they should do. For example, it was important for my father to get his steroids to heal his lungs however, he kept vomiting I suggested they give him the steroid via IV and the doctor responded ""that's a good idea, are you a doctor"" confused why a doctor who went to med school for so many years could not think of that.

I was there for Saturday lunch. Finding their parking lot behind the building after cruising by the storefront, I walked in to a warm smile from the owner/server, who directed me to a deuce along the wall, a discreet distance from the two occupied tables. She went to the rear cashier area and returned moments later with a glass of water and the two menus available for dinner and lunch specials. She quietly explained the two lists and left me again to give me time to consider my choices. 

I went with the afternoon combo - a small cup of coconut lemongrass soup (Tom Ka) veggied up with fresh mushroom on top, a bisected spring roll with dark orange dipping sauce, and a fairly large plate of Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodles). Liking spicy food, I opted for the ""Thai Spicy"" end of the heat spectrum. It did not disappoint. It added burn sufficient to make my tongue sweat and nose run, stopping just short of numbing my gums. Certainly no compromise for this western pallette. Loved every morsel of the thick noodles, chicken, green & red pepper, onion and green beans.

2750218,2,1,NdV4JLbYWN_W3oWZt_yzVA,"Very unprofessional.  I needed to make a change in my prescription, one that I had recently gotten from them.  The prescription was actually fine but I wanted to get a second prescription for the night because I was having depth perception issues.  When I made the appointment over the phone I was asked if it was for a follow up or if I was a new patient.  Since they had already done the eye test, it made sense to me to say it was a follow up.  
Well apparently they saw that as me trying to rip them off.  When I walked into the store I was met with an unfriendly attitude; with no sense of professional service they kept saying in a persecutive tone that they had finalized the prescription already.  This confused me since I had paid them for the order, of course I knew the order had been ""finalized"", but what does that have to do with why I'm coming in today??  Then it dawned on me that they thought I was trying not to pay for today's appointment because I told the receptionist that it was a ""follow up""!!  Holy #*#%!  Are you kidding?  Their definition of follow up is quite different from any real doctors definition, but they didn't bother to explain that to me until well after the fact.  They just assumed the worst.  
There was already a strike against them on my first visit, when the doctor had taken exception to me not wanting too strong of a prescription.  In a condescending tone she paralleled me questioning her eye prescription to a medical doctors prescription for diabetes, and that I should trust the experts and not question it.  Reality check- not the same thing and that's no way to speak to a customer.  
Back to today-
I did not want to deal with this hostility any longer so I walked out. But I did call a few minutes later, and asked what the hell was that about?  Only then did she realize I was fine paying for the service and that it was a misunderstanding of the term ""follow up"".  Although she apologized for the rude behavior, she continued to lecture me on what ""follow up"" means.  I told her I did not plan on using her business any longer and good luck.

I would not recommend this place to anyone and here is why...

To start off the dental hygentist was nice however was extremely aggressive when cleaning my teeth, my teeth NEVER hurt so much and I usually like going to the dentist. ALSO, If you need to have a cavity filled here is how they will you it works....

They will tell you that they offer Amalgam and another silver filling option. They will tell you that they have to order the Amalgam but they can offer the silver filling for $75 per tooth. They will give you a lecture on how the Amalgam has mercury in it which is harmful to your health...HOWEVER, yes Amalgam has mercury in it but there is NO SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE that it is harmful for your health due to the SMALL amount in the Amalgam. Since the 1990s, several federal agencies have reviewed the scientific literature looking for links between dental amalgam and health problems. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there is little scientific evidence that the health of the vast majority of people with dental amalgam is compromised, nor that removing amalgam fillings has any beneficial effect on health.
Here are the sources to defend this statement...

http://www.epa.gov/mercury/dentalamalgam.html
http://www.colgate.com/en/us/oc/oral-health/procedures/fillings/article/dental-amalgam-a-health-risk
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/DentalProducts/DentalAmalgam/ucm171094.htm#6

Furthermore, I called to schedule an appointment for my cavity to be filled and stated I would like to Amalgam, since I did not want to pay the extra $75 when I didn't need to due to the research available and other dentists I got a second opinion from over the phone. One of the ladies at the front desk then proceded to tell me that I would be better going to another dentist since they don't know when they are going to be getting the Amalgam in. I told her that I would wait until it came in and she continued to tell me that ""I should go to another dentist"" since I did not want to pay the extra money. 

Please take this into consideration because it's not fair to patients who put their trust in these ""dentists"" and they end up ""nickle and diming"" their patients when a more cost efficient method is available.",t2FKLTPNOrDLMS39RLk9Tw,1.0,2015-09-29 17:34:13,4yhY7nOw5z-jSbJ5mE9VGg,0,2015-09-29 17:34:13

I do wish I could give this hospital a better rating.  And before its most recent merger, I would have.

They did not dispense my medicines to me correctly -- not once in the entire week I was there.  This, despite being given a detailed list of the medications AND the pill bottles themselves as verification, the pharmacy was sending somebody else's medications to me!  

The nurses, angels of mercy that they are, bitterly complained to both me and my spouse about new procedures and having their hands tied at every step of the process.  God Forbid should the patient have a brain and know how to use it!  They are automatically disregarded by the doctors.  I truly pity the nurses who work there.  It must be hell for them.

Went in with intentions of a salad & appetizer, possibly a glass of win. 
After reading the menu, their sandwiches sounded too good to resist. Then the waiter came over listing about 5 or so ""specials"".  They all sounded great!  Ended up ordering the filet special, my husband the salmon.
I also indulged in a couple drafts as they had Weyerbacher Merry Monks on tap. Another pleasant surprise :)

Anyway -the food came out- I had a chimichanga sampler( 2 chimi's one beef and one shredded chicken)- They were amazing -the beans and rice were great too! The portions and prices were a real good deal. I loved my dinner and if not for the service being a bit slow- I would have given a 5 star!

It was good, but there was way too much pepper, and we like pepper but had to cut off the outside to eat it. I had a mojito, it was $9 and had no alcohol in it. I told the waitress and she just giggled and did not offer to discount the pricey sugar mint water. The ribs were awesome and so was the mac and cheese. The burger was great but it was raw. I ordered medium rare and I am not opposed to eating rare burgers but this was just raw. The fries were ok but a bit soggy. Desserts were great, we had the creme brulee and the banana dessert.We thought we would give it another try, so we went in one evening around 5 with my brother and his family.

2882411,1,1,rdLFuK8lJSh3k4chaoZ8jA,"Full disclosure I am actually sitting on a beach in Mexico so I feel my perception of the food at this place is relatively more accurate. 

I came here one evening after a call shift at Abington across the street. The cafeteria at A-ton is actually pretty decent compared to the one at my home institution but I'm not super keen on the lunch salad bar at 8:30pm. I ventured across Old York Road with a colleague to Senor Salsa. We've finally solved the mystery of why the chicken crossed the road. For fucking nachos, that's why.

We were seated at the high tops near the bar. On this particular occasion there were a few beer specials. I took advantage of one of the special'ed beers, as did my companion. Mixed drinks are also abundant. Margaritas are served in a giant goblet. 

We were provided chips with two different salsas and ravenously ripped through them. I went straight for the vegetarian portion of the menu, impressed by its presence.  Bc I'm ""dieting"", I ordered the vegetarian taco salad. My dining parter ordered tacos: chicken and I believe beef or some shit. 

Another impressive feature of this establishment is the speediness with which the food arrives. I had an early start the next morning and was not trying to waste any time. Impressive feature #3: they have valentina on every table. DROOOOOL. They also have a house hot sauce. 

My taco salad came in hot, plate contained within the waitress' grip. I slathered hot sauce over that bad boy and dove in. There's some lettuce, beans, sour cream, cheese probably, and tomatoes. I particularly remember the tomatoes as a matter of fact because they tasted weird. Otherwise, the taco salad was decent. I was starving to death so when I was finished, my plate resembled Sarajevo after the Bosnian war.  I also, ""wasn't going to eat the shell"". LOL. It was fried and delicious. 

Dining companion stated that his tacos were spectacular and kept commenting on how ""this was such a good choice"". Mine was good by virtue of the fact that it had cheese, beans, sour cream, and hot sauce inside a taco shell aka fried carbs. I wouldn't say it was particularly Mexican or depicted distinctly ""Mexican"" flavors. 

Prices and service were good. I can't speak for the quality relative to other Mexican offerings in Abington, PA. I'd come back if I was desperate.",C2vKa-eZFVBrfFGYXxvXFw,3.0,2017-10-05 00:24:19,oR5az_eNCnfN7e49H3ONhg,1,2017-10-05 00:24:19

Quality and service has dropped.  I got the veggie burger and the other in my party and apple salad.  The veggie burger that used to be great ----BUT THIS was a bag of mush with chopped lettuce, sad tomato and too few pickles.  The bread is white fluffy wonder bread kind of stuff- empty calories.  It used to be that you could get a salad with this meal but now only fries-AND THEY WANT ANOTHER FIVE DOLLARS FOR A SIDE SALAD.  This beet mush bag and fries cost 11$- if you want a veggie burger and fries go to ELEVATION BURGER- it will be organic and cost around 6$ and is better, and you get great toppings and service.

The apple salad was just barely ok- just skimpy for a 11$ price tag.  Our server was talking to the hostess and did not even glance my way when I was gagging for some more water.  REALLY a good server gives you a glance once in a while when they only have one table to wait on.

We ordered loaded nachos with NO meat, saying it probably four times to make sure. When they came out, they had beef and chicken on it. No big deal, just tell her we ordered it with no meat. The waitress literally YELLED at us, said extremely rudely that we did not specify no meat, and when I said politely that we did she got very hostile and actually stormed away.

For starters, they do not charge you for chips and salsa, which is a hallmark of Tex Mex cuisine. The chips are served warm, and the salsa is a red sauce. The have a series of cheap lunch items. I ordered a chicken fajita plate that came with rice and beans, 3 tortillas, guac, pico, lettuce, and sour cream. It was a huge portion, even for a lunch item. The fajita meat is very flavorful and packed with spicy. The refried beans had a nice blend of cheese on top. I don't have much else to say other than this is what I have been looking for.

Not all traditional mexican food, but more of an American-comfort food take on the food plus the few authentic dishes. The portions are big, the food is filling, the menu has MANY options for all types of choices. Instead of nachos, where the chips get soggy, try the cheese or bean dip- delicious!! The make your own combos are my favorite and come with rice and beans. You can have guacamole made fresh at your table, which is fabulous! The happy hour special at the bar is great- $2.99 margaritas (which are delicious). My family and I have been a few times and we had great service and wonderful food (with leftovers) both times.

The service was as best as our server could do. It seemed as though she could have used the help of the other staff just milling around. The amount of my wood fired shrimp pasta was scant for the $17 dollars though it was very good. It may not have seemed so little if there was bread on the table, but at 7:30 pm the place had run out of bread for the evening!  Perhaps they could've run down the street to the Giant  for some bread. They had enough workers standing around to do so!  We are a family of 5 and eat out a good deal. We are used to having leftovers from a restaurant. The amount was so little for the money we didn't have any to take home. I'll overlook the fact that they brought me more pasta to enjoy the rest of my meal with but then told me after I began eating  that they would charge me $3 additional for it.  The polite server told me I didn't have it added to my bill if I opted not to take the additional pasta (already given to me, already twirled on my fork and already in my mouth!)

The owner is there every time I've been there and is very attentive and friendly.  The place is clean and the decor is well done and interesting.

The bar area is not large and the place has been busy since they opened so just be prepared to have a wait on busy nights.  It's a new restaurant and they are getting into their own groove.  Definitely a change from the soft open day till last night when I ate there last.  They are smoother each time.  

Food wise I think it's very good and reasonably priced.  It's americanized mexican food/tex mex.  The veggie quesadilla was better than I expected and served like a wrap/fold over almost.  I have had the enchiladas multiple times and really liked them.  The Tacos Margaritas was very good.  The carnitas fajitas was delicious, the pork was so darn good and tender.

2938440,7,13,97h7dBs7DazIx5EnJkzcNw,"My family of three visited this establishment. And being new, I suspect they are still figuring out some kinks. 
There is no longer a joke in Abington with this building. They had been prepping this place for so long , it was a joke. Where should we meet? ""Senor Salsa,"" proceeded by chuckles. 

First, the decor is festive. Some hand painted murals on the walls. Overall nice appearance. 
The chips and salsa came out quickly. Pretty standard Mexican restaurant food. Nothing special about either, very typical. 

The menu is extensive and overwhelming there are so many different choices. 
My son went for his standard eating out, ""Mac and Cheese."" 

I ordered a two part combo of a hard taco and taquito. I really liked the Taco. It was flavorful. And the tortilla was excellent. I should have ordered more was my thought. 
The taquito, I was not a big fan of. It lacked flavor. Maybe I should have saved some of the lettuce and cheese on the side of the plate for it. But, it was just enough for the Taco. 
For some reason, they brought the beans and rice on a side plate. Almost like they forgot to put it on the plate in the first place. They did that to a table next to us as well.

My wife had some kind of shrimp enchilada. It was a good portion size. She had a full plate of lettuce, guacamole, cheese and sour cream to go with it. I should have taken some for my flavorless taquito. 

So, one major issue with the night. The length of time for us to get our food. We waited a long time. The waiter told us twice it will come soon. We have no idea why our table took so long. The table next to us which came after us, with more people got their food a lot faster. With such a long wait we should have had a comp. for dessert or something. Granted this place is packed and completely full. But, there should be some kind of apology and explanation.

We did order dessert. It came back to us quickly. The standard fried ice cream. And it was delicious.

I will return to this restaurant in the future. It is decent enough and not expensive. Once the crowds settle down it hopefully will be better. 

As explained in other reviews, the parking lot is small. 
The entrance if you have to wait is small. Not enough room for people to stand as they wait for a table to open up.

Went here tonight with some lovely coworkers for happy hour drinks and food. I did read some recent reviews to know what to prepare myself for and they were absolutely right . Service was fast and friendly but that's about it . There was no happy hour menu advertised at the table and when I asked the server he said only certain house margaritas and beer , not mentioning a price .  Our whole table got margaritas and I wasn't blown away definitely had better . My next drink was an apple martini which tasted so bitter to me I couldn't finish . My last drink was a strawberry daiquiri which was good so I was atleast satisfied with that . My coworker really wanted a coconut margarita but we were informed they weren't making them. But why ? Why have a whole menu with different frozen margarita choices and not have them . Instead they only said lime , mango or peach on the rocks were our only margarita choices.  Was not happy with this at all and they need to advertise properly and offer better drinks to customers not a half assed excuse because someone probably doesn't wanna make something during happy hour time . The food was mediocre, definitely had better at Taco Bell. I got a spinach quesadilla which had way too much spinach like it's something called balance which they don't know here.  My other fellow diners also got way too much onions and tomatoes on their quesadillas. It's nothing to write home about , again just saying I've had way better at Taco Bell and restaurants in the city for real Mexican fare. I will not be returning to this place , I guess people just go here out of convenience . Better food is found elsewhere in this area .

Walking into the restaurant, I felt as though the person who decorated the place had no concept of a theme or even knew what Mexican culture was. It looked like the person just put whatever they felt was stereotypical Mexican on the walls and then patted themselves on the back. I was offended and I'm not even Mexican. Getting to the food, I ordered one of their make your own burritos while my friend ordered their chicken fajitas. It only got placed after our server had to check the menu himself while still at our table. We received our chips and salsa afterwards, which surprised the both of us since we did not get then before giving our order. If the restaurant had been busy we would have been understanding, however, there were only maybe 4 or so small groups and one large group. Our chips were warm...for a split second and then they got cold which brought out their stale taste, plus there more broken chips then whole chips. 
We finally got our food and were surprised by the portion size, but then we suspected they were trying to match the food size with the food price. However we both knew that bigger doesn't mean better. In my burrito I got chicken and rice, and the rest of what I had asked for, lettuce, pico de gallo, cheese, and sour cream, were all sloppily thrown onto the top of the burrito. The chicken and the rice had no taste whatsoever, Taco Bell puts more seasoning in their food. Its like the chef in the kitchen was scared to put even a little bit of spice in the food. I even tried to put some of their salsa on to add a little flavor but that did little to nothing. My friend's chicken fajitas were no different, the chicken and rice once again had no taste and her fajita vegetables, green pepper and onion, were burnt. You could barely make out the color of the vegetables to identify what they were because of the blackness. On top of that her chicken was dry, and her guacamole salad was just avocado, there were no other spices in the guacamole. Her beans were like paste, if they had wanted to they could have used her beans to put up more of their horrifying statues or wallpaper. While we did not order any alcoholic drinks we saw other customers order them and they were huge. My friend brought up the point that the drinks are probably so huge because you need to be tipsy or drunk to be able to enjoy this food. In my opinion we should have kept driving because Senor Salsa is a complete joke. With the money spent we could have had a full on feast at Taco Bell and would have been way more satisfied.

Seasoned perfectly, and the shredded chicken was moist and flavorful. The quesadilla was basically the same thing in a different shape, but it tasted just as good. The chips and salsa were overkill at this point, but I saved them for later. They were still delicious when I got to them hours later.

I came on a Saturday night during their opening weekend so I expected service to be slow. The food, however, was inexcusably bad. Chicken and beef were bland. The sauce they smother all over their burritos was too salty. The salsa tasted like it came from a store-bought jar. I also didn't like that there were fees associated with everything.

Mom-mom had the scallop special which were perfectly seared large diver scallops, balsamic reduction with sautéed vegetables; really nice. I should mention that the scallops were cooked perfectly, not overdone like many restaurants have a tendency to do. The kids had a burger, chicken and french dip sandwiches which were all solid if nothing special. I can say the burger was cooked perfectly medium as requested. The accompanying french fries were excellent (and a great match with my Belgian style beer)! Deserts were good but nothing special. Chocolate peanut butter cake, cheesecake, etc, probably made elsewhere and shipped in but all tasty nonetheless.

I was reluctant at first but pleasantly surprised by my experience at Timber Grill. The dining room is cozy and everything was fresh and well prepared and all the young servers were pleasant and attentive. I would recommend this place, especially for large groups when it's hard to please everyone.",jUyoND2GoaRRVS_t_HN6SQ,4.0,2012-03-19 14:56:41,v4fP6TjVxM5fbAjlxBQyFg,0,2012-03-19 14:56:41
2986305,10,6,_wXcZVmZbJqFezQW2OpwGA,"Terrible name, excellent grub. I'm grading on a curve since it's mexican food in the suburbs of Philadelphia, not mexican food in Texas, San Diego, or Cancun. 

First off, it's authentic mexican - not ""american"" mexican, so don't expect a Chipotle or Taco Bell-taste-experience. 

I probably go here every six weeks since I live nearby, and I haven't been disappointed yet. The margaritas are generous and come in a bunch of flavors. Maybe at some point I'll combine five of them into one big Voltron-rita.

...Don't steal my idea.

I never come during lunch, but they have serious lunch specials. Don't blame my review if you go back to the office with the mexican food gas, though.

The menu is huge. It probably weighs as much as two Mad Mex™ menus. There are even options for people with zero imagination, like burgers. 

Everything I've ever ordered has been tasty. Tamales, Tacos, Burritos, Enchiladas, Chimichangas (Deadpool approved), carne asada...

Servers are friendly and service is generally pretty quick, even when they're crowded. Oh, and I can't forget ... free chips and salsa! That's always at least worth a star. Free is always a way to my heart.

He ended up disappointed and not inclined to come back. The experience, from the atmosphere to the food was, in a word, bland.

We ordered the fried calimari appetizer, a winner in most restaurants. Disastrous. The only thing light about the batter was the color. We detected no seasoning whatsoever and the calamari did not have that springy texture that makes it work. The fried tomatoes, artichokes, and peppers at least had a little character.

My friend's ribs were properly cooked but again the sauce lacked character and the meat had little flavor. Marinade? Aromatic smoke? A creative sauce? Try something!

Our server warned me that the lamb bolognese was ""spicy,"" which is suburban speak for ""properly seasoned.""  Indeed it was. The rigatoni were cooked perfectly, the lamb was seasoned well, and the cheese and herbs complemented the other spices beautifully.

In the end though, the food was uneven, the presentation never made one think ""wow, that looks good,"" and it's obvious why three quarters of the tables sat empty.

3014392,5,15,OanMv8Qth7YOBN9HJT8myA,"I ate here with my boyfriend last Saturday. We both enjoyed it. We started off with large house margaritas...he got strawberry, I got Mango. They were both delicious, and there was a good amount for the price of $9. 

We split an app-Nachos w/ pico. All of their nachos come with cheese, and you can choose other toppings as well. I wish more topping came on them standard. If you want to add sour cream, that's more, guac is $2 more etc. So our nachos were just pico & american cheese.

We both got 2 burritos for our entrees. I got chicken, and he got beef. They forgot the re-fried bean on his, but he still enjoyed it. I enjoyed mine as well.
They have a TON of selections for entrees including dinner combos which allow you to try one burrito, one taco, enchilada, etc.

One complaint (as someone mentioned below) is that they nickle and dime you for everything. most of the dishes don't come with that many-or any-toppings. 
At Mad Mex, I normally get fajitas- which come with lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, guac, shredded cheese, rice, and salsa. Here, fajitas only come with sour cream, tomatoes, and one other topping I believe...all of the rest cost extra, which can add up quickly. If you want a refill on the complimentary chips and salsa, that costs extra too. 

The checks are hand written, and not itemized,which is a little weird. 

Our total was $56( before tip). with a 20% tip, our total came to $67. That is VERY expensive compare to other local places.

The bar area is small, but there is a large TV you can watch. The booths are comfy as well. 

Overall, I would eat here again, especially for the margaritas, and to get an appetizer (not to share one, because apparently they charge you $5 to share it). As far as entrees go, I think Mad Mex has better food, better prices (if you like having all the toppings like I do), and more beer selections.

The only thing that could been added as an option for people that really don't like the refried beans maybe plantains?

If you do indulge ,their mucho margaritas are amazing .. not watered down and just the right amount of kick to enjoy.. I especially enjoy the mango. Their crab tacos are delicious which I was very glad as they were not filled with imitation crab meat .

I work nearby, so I called in to place an order for the ASAP 1 special: a taco (chicken or beef), a cheese quesadilla, and fries for $5.99. I looked at the menu on their website, then called in. The host kept asking #13? #13? I had to tell him several times that I wasn't sure what number lunch special it was- it does not say online. I told him the name of it and what it consisted of. I also specifically asked for a chicken taco- I don't eat beef. When I got there, he rang me up for $13. I told him that I had only ordered a lunch special and it should cost $5.99, I even had to show him the menu. After a little confusion (on his part) he rang me up for the proper cost. He then said I couldn't pay with a card. (They do have a piece of paper taped to the register that states $10 minimum for cards) I told him that their website does not state that anywhere, nor was I told this over the phone when I placed my order. He just stood there with a blank stare on his face. If I had cash, I'd pay cash, but I didn't have any on me. He then got a paper menu and showed me the fine print on the front that says $10 minimum on credit cards. I told him ""that's fine, now I know for future purchases, but when I ordered, I used the website menu, which does not state that."" He said OK and took my card anyhow.

3069078,0,5,mi7jtv5Ndrmd1lOr3meExg,"My wife and I went to Timber essentially by accident on Saturday night. We were out doing some picking up a few things and decided to stop and grab dinner. After stopping at 2 of the chain restaurants in the area and finding half hour plus waits we were going to just head home. 

Not really in the mood to cook as it was already almost 8pm, I pulled out my Blackberry and took a quick check on OpenTable to see what was available near by. Timber popped up as a new option so my wife and I decided to give it a try. 

We got there around 8:15 and found the restaurant to still be very busy, but we were seated right away thanks to that fortuitous OpenTable reservation. The ambiance of the restaurant was very nice, giving off a comfortable feel. 

We decided to try out the standard flat-bread as an appetizer and when it came out it was excellent. The flat-bread was cooked perfectly, it was crispy on the bottom but still doughy on the top. It was topped with arugula, tomatoes and a balsamic dressing (we skipped the mushrooms because my wife doesn't eat ""fungus""). It was good enough and large enough that had it been my entree I would've happy with it. 

For an entree I went with the wood grilled Rib-eye steak that was a special on the recommendation of the waiter instead of the NY Strip. He definitely knew what he was talking about because the steak was great. It was dry-aged, lightly spiced and had been cooked perfectly over a wood fire giving it a little bit of a smoky flavor. I would highly recommend it if it's available. It came with a loaded baked potato, which was good, but a little on the smaller side. 

My wife ordered Chicken Caesar Salad for dinner and had to get a side of Mac & Cheese when she saw it on the menu. She only ate a little bit of the salad having filled up on the flat-bread but enjoyed it. (I thought it was pretty good as my lunch on Sunday) However she absolutely loved the Mac & Cheese. It was very cheesy and had a nice crusted topping. 

Throughout the night the waitstaff was spectacular. There wasn't more than a moment when an empty plate or glass sat on the table. Either our waiter or one on the others would scoop it up almost instantly. 

Timber is not an inexpensive place to eat, running me $100 for 2 entrees and appetizer and 2 glasses of wine. However, the experience was a memorable one and the cost was worth what we received. 

In conclusion I would highly recommend giving Timber a try. We will most certainly be going again. 

So on the power of the great food, comfortable ambiance and wonderful waitstaff Timber is going to get a rare, but certainly well earned, 5 stars. 

UPDATE: We heard Timber was serving Brunch now and decided to give it a try on Sunday morning. 

I ordered the Timber Omelet, which was absolutely incredible. The omelet was very large and perfectly fluffy. 

My wife had the stuffed French Toast with caramelized bananas (it normally comes with caramelized peaches, but she was being picky). It was was also wonderful. 

To top it off the breakfast potatoes were some of the best I've ever had.

3079008,0,2,yKvI9qJ9cW9oRjkqzhG7XQ,"I am torn on how to review this place. Best way is to explain our experience and let you decide what to think. 
I was interested in a new non-chain restaurant in our area. I was not sure what to expect. Inside you have a publike feel in decor, kind of a rustic feel to the place. The staff are friendly and seated us out of the way, as we had a four year old in tow. 
The menu is small, but interesting. Who needs a zillion choices, keep it simple seems to be the idea. Plenty to like for the seafood or meat eater. 
I was happy when I saw the beer choices and some delicious craft non-standard beers were the selection. I had a lovely dark stout. So, they may be trying to get some of the gastro-pub crowd. 
The orders for the night, a filet, chicken fingers and Lamb Bolognese. 
We got no bread, but had bread plates. I saw no one else receiving it either. 
First, my sons chicken fingers. Uh, you can tell they do not get children even though they have a childrens menu. He received 3 huge pieces of chicken and a suffle dish of mac and cheese. It should be enough for 3 meals for him. He ate most of one piece of chicken and it was done superbly. More than any 4 year old taste buds deserves. The waitress went on about the care that went into them. Clearly not a frozen chicken meal. Hand prepared on the premises and breaded. 
Second, my choice was the Lamb pasta dish. It was superb as well. Lovely flavors in the dish and lots of cheese and fennel taste to it. It is rustic and delightful. The pasta did not seem to be an out of the box variety. But, I did not ask if it was premises made. 
Third, this is where the problems came the simplest dish to prepare a medium rare filet. It took them a few tries to get it right. It came back at first well done. The waitress was pissed and knew they screwed up. Then the second attempt came back nearly raw, it was cold in the center. So they took it back to cook a little more. The taste was wonderful once it was cooked right. I would gladly order it again if the cook can get it right. It had a heavenly flavor, they get that much right.
So we finished the evening with dessert, a scooop of ice cream for the son, a bananna surprise and key lime cheese cake. 
I did not try the cheese cake or ice cream so I can only review the item I had. It was a delicious concoction of banannas done several ways with a lovely caramel, chocolate and other toppings. All put into a phylo dough shell and lovely walnuts for texture and flavor. I am a huge caramel fan and could tell it was not  a squirt bottle variety. It was clearly home made. It was delicious and if we return I will gladly order again. 
The only reason they are not four stars is the issue with cooking the meat. I would not recommend the location for young kids. Although, they were fine with our four year old, its probably a little too nice for kids his age.",jUyoND2GoaRRVS_t_HN6SQ,3.0,2010-11-01 14:07:56,xOr3cP1xO2qC4lx2E9jnBg,1,2010-11-01 14:07:56

Nope.  The ambiance was clean, but I didn't like the country checkerboard tablecloths. That plus the white haired lunch crowd really made me feel less than inspired.

The waitress was very nice.  Service was not an issue.  However, we didn't get any bread to start so I didn't like that.  I had a bellini which was OK.  Then I ordered the scallops for lunch.  Two scallops came out on a huge mound of chunky rissoto.  The rissotto was cooked properly, but it wasn't very good tasting.  There were huge tomatoe chunks and big chunks of slab bacon.   I didn't like it that much.  The scallops were slightly opaque which was fine, but I prefer they be cooked just right.  The tasted OK but were really salty.  The caesar salad was also OK.

This is probably as close as you can get to Authentic this far north of the border.  I ordered a lunch combo with a beef burrito and beef hard taco. I also ordered chips and salsa. The taco was dead on perfect. The burrito was more like an enchilada. 

The big factor for me is the salsa. I like it fresh. Considering the place is called Señor Salsa I would have expected just that. However the salsa tasted like some of it was from a jar.

3087796,1,7,QVHZRPJSG4MWOHetB4QeKg,"Mexican food should be three things...Simple, Flavorful, Cheap.  Senor Salsa misses the mark each time.

The simple review is this: I realize that Mexican food is in short supply in the area.  You should cook it yourself or travel out a bit further to enjoy it.  If you enjoy margaritas and beer more than food, then down a few, get your buzz on, and chow down.  Senor Salsa is not good Mexican food, and honestly it just barely reaches the decent mark for food of any genre.

Now for the part where I rant a bit:

If you've read my other reviews, you will know that I spent many years living in Texas, where Tex-Mex and authentic Mexican food have deep roots.  I'm spoiled, I know.  In the spirit of equality I try not to use my Texas experience as a measuring stick for other Mexican food around the country.  Some places will have better, and some places worse.  This place is just silly.

You and your friends devour that first basket of chips 'n' salsa?  Expect to pay for the second round, only the first is free.

Did you ever pay for lettuce?  it's .50 on this menu.

Want to share your giant burritos?  Expect to pay $5 as a sharing fee (it's plastered all over the menu)

Expecting rice AND refried beans on your plate? Prepare for disappointment.

Want Fajitas?  You won't be eating them with your friends, since they take 25-30 min to prepare (as per the menu).

Parking is tough, its a small lot.

People are flocking here.  I went on a thurs night at 6:15 and it was packed.  I certainly understand the reason.  The area lacks much in the way of Mexican food options, and instead of waiting at Mad Mex they are coming here.

I'm not a connoisseur of Mexican food, but thanks to other chains, I always thought a burrito was  a tortilla wrapped around a choice of meat, beans, rice with maybe lettuce and/or salsa or something all wrapped up in a tubular shape.  This was a tortilla around seasoned meat, with unappetizing beans on the side, and some form of rice, also on the side.  Price was really reasonable as well.
after one bite, I really should have sent it back, it was the single-most  salty piece of food I think I ever put in my mouth.  I ate it anyway, mostly because I was hungry, and thanks to a full house, food took longer to get than expected.

Food.
Bring a notebook because I had to study this menu. A very extensive menu. I was overwhelmed with the amount of dishes so I just played it safe and started out with carne (beef) nachos and a chicken burrito. Nachos were good not great but lots of them, very cheesy, and went well with my $3 margarita. If you read the previous comments the burrito is more like an enchilada - comes with melted cheese on top - and I had to use a fork and knife to eat it. With that said still a very good burrito and it came with pico de gaio(?) and fried rice. Lots to eat at a good price.

First impression:
Saw Señor Salsa being redone for a while and wondered when it would finally be open but I can tell why it took so long. Yes the parking lot is on the small side but there is little that can be done about it. The inside looks very nice and set the atmosphere for a hearty Mexican meal. Walked in and seated right away; within a minute nachos and salsa were served at our table. Salsa seemed out of a store bought jar.

Service.
Within minutes our waiter was at our table to take our drink orders. We came at a time when about half the restaraunt was filled and was overall pleased with our service.

Overall.
Im not going to say I'm a Mexican food connoisser. I'm not even going to say I'm a picky eater so take what you will. Not the most authentic Mexican food but still was pleased with the meal. Considering the choices of Mexican food in the area, would say it is at least worth a try. Disappointed in the salsa (considering their name is Señor Salsa) but everything else seemed fresh and for the most part tasty. Overall good experience.

From the moment we walked in, the aroma of wood and fire put a smile upon our faces.  The evening only got better from there.

We were served 3 single-serving pieces of the most delicious bread with whipped butter.  I had to ask for another helping as it was too good to leave without having some more.

She had ""The Dip"" which featured the most tender of meats.  It just melted in your mouth.  The horseradish was more about the flavor than the bite, which is quite fine with us.

I had the Seared Sea Scallops entree served on a bed of smoked bacon risotto, which had a drizzle of a sweet balsamic reduction.  Oh. My. God.  The scallops were perfectly cooked and seared.  The risotto was creamy and featured a perfect blend of flavors.  The balsamic reduction was the perfect compliment for the scallops.  Heaven in your mouth.  The only complaint I have is that you only get 4 scallops.  For $24, this price is a bit steep for the amount of food on the plate, however the experience of eating this made this dish worthy (or close to it) of my $24.

We'd also like to recommend the cinnamon créme brulee for dessert.

The decor was interesting; the ambiance was warm and cozy, but one thing that stuck out like a sore thumb was the red & white checkerboard upholstery on the chairs (and whatever else that pattern may have been on).

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  :)  Thanks, Timber Grill!

The downside is that it would appear they've spent so much on the renovation that it directly impacted the prices. Its a bit steep for what they offer.

It took almost 30 minutes before the waiter came over to take our drink orders.  We had to then wait another 30 minutes (one hour total) before our food order was taken.  It seemed that they were short staffed, which if that was the case, we should have been told before being seated and we would have better understood the situation.

As for the food and drinks.  Even though some of the drinks were wrong, they were AMAZING!  That is why I am giving two stars instead of one.  I can't remember the last time I was at a restaurant where the drinks were heavy on the alcohol and tasted amazing.  

Now for the not so good.  The food was underwhelming.  I am not trying to be mean or nasty, but the server who brought the food over could not communicate very well and it was extremely confusing trying to figure out what dish went to each person.  Most of the food was luke warm even though the plates were too hot to touch.  

I can't talk for the other peoples food, but mine was sub-par and incorrect.  I ordered the Burrito de Casa and asked if I could have one with chicken and one with steak.  I was told, of course, no problem.  They were both chicken.  Fine, I've been waiting 1.5 hours approximately for food so I just wanted to eat.  There was a sign at the door saying there was an avocado shortage and dishes that normally came with guacamole would be substituted with something else.  None of us had any kind of substitution for the guacamole.  Finally, the burritos were SMOTHERED with so much cheese that I couldn't taste anything else.  I removed the cheese covered tortillas and ate the chicken and veggies so I could taste something other than cheese.

All in all, I highly doubt I or any of us would go back, and if we did, it would be for drinks and apps.

3154945,1,3,09pQNb5XmqPpH7i6wNBGSg,"This place is relatively new, so I'm assuming they will work out some of the kinks soon enough. That said, they definitely need to get a handle on estimated wait time. If you tell someone 45 minutes, and it winds up being almost twice that long to get a table, something isn't quite right. 

The neighborhood was in desperate need of a large Mexican restaurant; there are some smaller authentic ones nearby, and of course there are some Chipotles mostly anywhere you look, but there was a real need for a place to go when you want a big menu, some tableside guac, burritos and enchiladas, and a bar.  Senor Salsa, which has had success elsewhere (Connecticut, for instance), if it can continue to improve, can fill that void. 

The first issue is the weird rules all over the menu. You can't share. How strict are they about that? It's almost so comical that you want to test it out to see if someone will really be monitoring how you eat your meal, but the steep price tag is scary.  Another oddity? Chips and salsa for the table is not complementary. But the name of the restaurant is Senor Salsa! So read all the fine print. There's a lot of it, and if you break a rule, you may find yourself with a large bill. 

(Note: If you order the tableside guacamole, the chips that come with it are included, thus temporarily solving the chips for the table conundrum.)

The food is pretty good. I ordered an enchilada plate with four different kinds: bean, cheese, beef, and chicken. The bean and chicken enchiladas were good. The cheese enchilada was inedible. The cheese was very odd.  The beef was practically inedible.

There's only two reasons this restaurant missed a 5th star--they need more waiters to improve speed and friendliness of service....and customers should never be made to wait for the owner's family's incessant requests. Our hostess 'seated' us at a table next to the owner's family. The waiter was blocking my entry to the table. I stood and waited for him to finish speaking, so as not to interrupt what I thought were other guests initially. After a few minutes I said excuse me and asked to get to my seat. The whole time the owner's family was looking at me standing there and said nothing. Then, every few minutes, they called the waiter over to bring a new dish or a different beverage, and if it took too long they loudly complained (loudly enough that we quickly learned they were not just 'guests'.) Restaurant patrons should not hear owners' families complaining about their own restaurant!!! Our waiter was so flustered by their demands, that it slowed up our service and that of the surrounding tables. At the end of our meal, the owner himself did ask how the food was, which we appreciated.

The massages weren't terrible but they weren't great either. No door to the room, and there were like very noticeable foot prints in oil on my paper, like they didn't change it so I did.  The ""lavender eye wrap"" was freezing cold, seem to have any lavender to it and seemed to be the same as the eye mask that I have at home from cvs. My masseuse changed midway through so there was a 5 minute in between where I was just laying on the table with no service. The masseuse told me it was time for her to go home and someone else would finish... umm, ok. Why would you schedule someone's ""Shift"" to end in the middle of an massage appointment? You would think they would just work per patient. My husbands masseuse also left for 5-7 minutes where he was just laying there. I would say it's more of a ""rub"" than a massage... not much pressure or technique to it. My husband masseuse kept slipping off when trying to use her arms or elbow on my husbands legs and he said it was really uncomfortable. They didn't use enough oil either, it was a rather dry massage. They also didn't touch my legs at all, and for my husband they forgot to massage his right leg, only did his left. How do you forgot body parts or spend 45 minutes on the torso and never touch anything else?

There were so many highs and lows to this place that 3 seems to fit.  The ambiance and decor had that nice cantina look, very authentic feeling. The lighting was low, which was romantic, but made reading the expansive menu very hard.

The highs-the chips tasted fresh made, nice crunch and warmth. The tamale was great, very close to the ones I had in my trips to Arizona. I feel the prices were just right.

Middling- the salsa did not taste fresh, came from a jar. A good jar but still a jar. The toppings were very fresh, especially in the taco. But there was no real flavor to it, nor the burrito or the chimichangas the wife had. Just nothing there.

My chili releno was awful, greasy breading falling loose. It was so dark it took me 3 bites to say that was a stuffed chili.

Cause, this place would be a distant second. Keep in mind I'm a California gurl so I have been known to eat Mexican food. But this is the Philadelphia suburbs so... authentic it isn't. 

For example, the chimichangas were so small, you had to move a round the lettuce and sour cream to locate the little bastards. Consequently, they were pretty soggy. The taquitos were pretty tasty actually, but they tasted better when I heated them up the next day and added my own salsa. The chips and salsa were quite bland, which escapes comprehension. How the ...? Whatever. 

The service was not good. As a matter fact the other members of my party were so unhappy with the service that they decided to leave a 5% tip, ouch‼ since they paid the bill, I was in no position to bogart, but that was rough.

There are very limited options for dinner along 611 and Timber just adds depth to the selections.  I think what stands out is what you are getting for the price.  I think the portions are plenty for what you pay and the food is very good.  Wood fired home cooked meals is never a bad thing.  However, what should really turn heads is the wine list.  They offer high quality wines from top producers like Trefethen, Truchard, Randy Mason's ""Pomelo"" and Mill Creek at prices that are unreal.  Example: Trefethen Double T, a family estate owned winery from Napa Valley  with a suggested retail value of about $20-$25 that you can have by the glass for $12.  The owners want to provide value and quality to their customers and it shows.  Im not a review person, I don't invest all my beliefs in what others write about a restaurant, I need to experience it myself.

I moved last year, too far away to continue with my former trusted mechanic.
I tried the local dealership, and after a few head scratching experiences, I decided to move on.

I knew I needed brakes/rotors, so I was on a quest for a new trusted mechanic.
I did my research. I reached out to a half dozen or so mechanics
to see how they would handle the simplest interaction, 
 a phone conversation and a quote. 
Tom on his day off, quickly returned my call. He was respectful, and without having to ask, quoted me best/worst case scenarios.

He also scheduled me on day where I would not have to leave my car overnight, and was convenient to me. I still gave the others the same shot. No one came close to Tom's first impression. 

Today, Tom did my brakes, himself. He was friendly, and low key.
Tom, without asking,  gave me the scope of what he was going to do to make a determination of what my car needed. I knew what I needed before I went, but was awaiting to see if he would try and take advantage or be honest.  He was honest, and without asking, stuck to the price he quoted me. I did not ask, however he showed me the old parts and explained to me what had happened to get them in their current condition. 

Driving home, my brakes are back to normal and do not even squeal.
In parting, two things :
One, I feel good abt the decision I made. 
Two, I will be back

We had called ahead and made a reservation for 12 tonight. Our party ended up only being 8 and they were able to accommodate us. 

Salsa and chips were immediately brought out to the table. The chips came out warm. They're not stingy with the chips. They brought out 3 generously portioned baskets of chips. We ordered table side guacamole (one spicy and one regular) and both were excellent. We also got a side of queso for those who didn't want to eat the guac. 

For my entree, I ordered my usual - a jumbo vegetarian quesadilla. Could've been a little bit cheesier but it was still great. I asked for a to-go box because it was a huge plate. 

My friend ordered Camarones a la Diabla. This is a spicy dish. It has rice mixed in with shrimp and lettuce. They cook the shrimp with the Diabla sauce but you can also ask for the sauce on the side and they'll give it to you. 

We skipped out on dessert, but I had a glass of sangria after my meal and it was good. Not sure if it's worth $6.50/glass but it was a tasty sangria.

3216904,0,0,athP7sSQYbMUCL-PGOtAgA,"I hate writing a bad review for this place because I've been here dozens of times but I guess I now have to.  Food is great and atmosphere is pretty cool too. It is decorated much in the way the Mexico pavilion is at Epcot. My family being Disney nerds, we appreciate that a bunch. Also, I keep coming back  because I don't feel like I get MSG withdraw the next day like the crappy Chili's down the street.
It's the service which has tanked. It used be so on point. The owner has much pride in his business to the point that I've even gone out of my way before to thank him for the experience. Some of his servers are still good. You got to get one of the longer employed Hispanic ones it would seem because the newer ones or anyone else just suck.
And this isn't an isolated time. It's been maybe the last 4 or 5 times that service was way off. It's gotten to the point that I think about not going because I got to deal with paying extra (a tip) for someone to pay little attention to us. I've done takeout from there before. Maybe I'll just skip the idiot burnouts who serve there and pick up my food. We sat there for 2 hours today!
Maybe it's the kitchen too. Who knows but last time the one girl brought my boy his burger wrong twice. I get that mistakes happen (even twice) but the incident also got unprofessional as well. First strike: Waitress who retrieves the mistaken order back doesn't say sorry. I think this actually an American cultural problem because many servers try to dodge blame but lady, you represent the establishment. You are liaison to the kitchen. Apologize on their behalf. I wouldn't usually be so hypercritical since ya get crappy service everywhere nowadays but I'm trying to form a picture here. When she takes the plate she then proceeds to point it out to the greeter/seater so that we can hear. This presumably was to shift blame and preserve her tip. She said ""this is what always happens.j"" Now that was a No No in my book. You are part of the establishment lady. You go down with the ship. If the kitchen can't take instructions, can't read, doesn't care or whatever the problem is, you are the face to the whole establishment. You all failed together. So just apologize and correct. So eventually after 2 tries they get the burger right. Once it had lettuce, the second strike, no cheese.
So this visit, refills slow, also asked 4 separate people if the guacamole guy was coming. Took the guy 20 minutes to ring my card and bring back boxes. Once the guacamole came it was the best. I mean seriously, this place is authentic. The Chili Rellenos is really good. I don't feel like I'm leaving in a MSG coma either when I leave but I'm usually stuffed.

Seems to be better when the owner is there.  Let me be clear. I like this spot and I'm not trying to hurt the guy's business. The owner is there watching over the operation. He's not absentee but something is off lately. The food is worth the wait but the guy is losing money because there have been times when I was made to wait. We stayed 1 hour more than we needed to stay today. That held up his table for an hour!
Honestly, servers just suck in the country. When I visit higher establishments or go to other countries, service is a skill that seems to be worked at. I mean give me something for my 15, 20, 25%! A real pet peeve is when I'm talking with my company and the idiot server blurts out, so how is everything? (Not Senor Salsa) Well it was good until they assigned you to me buddy. A huge point of me being there is to talk with my company. Why as my server do you think you ought to be interrupting me? Well that doesn't happen much at Senor Salsa because I don't think English is many of their first language so they shy from speaking and just refill, which is awesome! Try to be invisible yet effective. I love rewarding with a good tip. If I'm talking don't say a thing. Ok now I'm just going on a general rant.
Senor Salsa is a great place in general. Food is good but reasonable. Something needs to be done with the servers. I get that it's a hard job. On your feet all night, taking orders all over the place but it's an opportunity to make comparatively more money for a no skilled job. Servers need to figure out that I'd rather get my own food unless I'm truly gonna get served. I'm not there to move in. Im there to eat, pay and leave. My hope is that the owner sees this and fixes it. He's losing money. Certainly don't rush your patrons but if they want to vacate your table don't hold them hostage either. The guy took 20 minutes to ring my card and bring me boxes.

3 stars for great food, great atmosphere but crappy service. I'll change my review if I see likewise.",C2vKa-eZFVBrfFGYXxvXFw,3.0,2019-04-14 22:12:51,srjHv1R6zbE7fMh8fzSFqA,0,2019-04-14 22:12:51

Finally bit the bullet and when there last night.  The service was sub-par...I usually don't let that deter me if the food is outstanding but it was really a rather uncomfortable experience.  They were also out of a few different items that we were interested in.  One member of my party had a glass of Cabernet and said it was horrible.  I am also a little put off by the prize...it all seemed to be a bit too expensive for what you were getting.  

The food was pretty good, and I appreciate their selection of local craft beer.  I enjoyed my wood grilled chicken sandwich and ""the dip"" was a nice bite too.  We had mussels that were cooked very well but didn't have enough broth in the bowl.  The flat-bread looked a bit overdone though I didn't get to try it.

Food:
Salsa is okay, chips are good as long as they come out hot. 
I had the California tacos. I was expecting small flour tortillas, but instead received two giant tacos made with fajita tortillas. Chicken and corn, not impressed with quality.

This place claims to be authentic . I ordered the flan, love me some flan. 
Not only was the flan terrible- probably frozen and thawed crap that didn't even taste like custard or caramel, THEY FLOODED IT WITH HERSHEYS SYRUP AND WHIPPED CREAM!!!  Flan... WTF

On the bright side was our waiter and the chips and salsa.  The burrito was ground beef and the taco was shredded chicken and lettuce.  Both were not very flavorful.  This place in one and done for me.  I am still looking for a genuine Mexican restaurant.,C2vKa-eZFVBrfFGYXxvXFw,1.0,2019-07-14 14:57:11,d_Qfst62sA1xHLMCmWFMOg,0,2019-07-14 14:57:11

They took me as soon as I got there (I had an appt) and brought me to my 'room'. I use quotes because it didn't have a door. It had a white curtain that didn't close all the way. Not creepy at all. Then my massage started with a female masseuse who seemed annoyed by my presence and 10 minutes in, she left and a male walked in and continued the massage. No explanation for the switch. It was fine just odd. The place is very small and no doors on the rooms so definitely not a relaxing environment. You could hear the cars driving by outside. The masseuses were all having loud conversations with each other from room to room and you could hear every word. Not sure the atmosphere they were going for but definitely wasn't relaxing. Finally done and got dressed and got home and my legs were really itching. Figured probably just reaction to the oils but when I took my clothes off to see what was going on there were literally ants in my pants. And they bit me. A lot.

Perhaps because of the scarcity of steak or because of the roll, or a combination of both,  the taste of the roll overpowered the taste of the steak.  The experience was like eating a french baguette with a hint of steak. I like french baguettes, but I ordered a cheesesteak.

A good cheesesteak makes me think, ""I wish I had enough room for two.""  This cheesesteak made me say, ""I'll just wrap this half up and maybe I'll get back to it later.""

3274828,5,12,w1FF3xKp5MSa60AAaG4YHA,"I was really looking forward to Senor Salsa, as a lover of Mexican food and a hater of very long waits for a table (Mad Mex.) Can I give less than 1 star? We went on a Saturday evening at 6:00, party of 2. We were seated quickly, and the first problem arose during seating. The hostess led us on a winding path through the dining room to get to our table in the alcove that runs down the side of the main dining room. There were places where we barely fit between the tables that she was leading us through. TOO, too many tables crammed in throughout all dining areas. Wait staff and diners alike had trouble fitting between them.
Next was the waiter, who did an OK job. But he definitely needs more training before being given a weekend rush shift. Had to ask for water 3x. Had to ask for extra olives for my drink twice and, when he did bring them, he brought them skewered on a drink straw with his hand underneath catch the drips! Dude, serve me my food on a plate, or at least a napkin. Also, when I asked him for help with the menu, he showed me one item (""only"" according to the server) containing the mole sauce I wanted. I had to find the others on my own. Poor training evident several times throughout the visit, for others employees as well. Let's move on.
We were unable to hear each other and, due to the volume level and a thick accent, could neither hear nor understand our server. This was a problem as the menus were very difficult to read (dark area, tiny print, glossy coating.)
The complimentary nachos chips were warm and good, but the salsa was from a jar. Ewww. My dining companion said his food was good, having ordered the Tres Amigos enchiladas. My dinner was their chicken mole. The chicken breasts were sliced thin but not pounded. They were grilled. They were hard and dry, with burnt edges that were not disguised by the heaping, soupy pile of fried onions and mole sauce (which didn't taste homemade) that made my plate look like someone had spilled chowder on it. No presentation whatsoever.
The real problem (which was exacerbated by the tables almost touching throughout the facility) were the diners at the next table - 3 tween/early teen boys and the young aunt of one of them. Their volume level was ridiculous. They were throwing food at each other (""adult"" included), yelling, jumping around, arguing, WRESTLING in the banquette seat, and more! Every diner around them was exposed to the behavior, but it was worst for the 4 tables flanking theirs. The other diners were looking around for help several times, but not one employee stepped in. Finally we'd had enough. We told them to behave themselves or leave, but our meal was long ruined. The other diners cheered us on as we tried to restore some order to the area, to no avail as the young lady argued with us that they weren't her kids, and therefore, it was not her fault. WTH?
So I go to the hostess stand to ask for the manager and the check. The hostess doesn't notice me for SO long (both she and the manager took to-go orders on the phone, ignoring their waiting walk-ins) that I poke my head into the drink prep station, where 4 waiters are working. I announce that I need the manager right away. None of them look at me, and finally one does so I repeat my request. He disappears (to look for the manager, I assume) and seconds later walks by but doesn't acknowledge me (mission accomplished, I assume). No manager ever comes. I wait and wait. Finally, I see the waiter again and ask him where the manager is. ""He's in the kitchen. He's busy."" He then tells me the manager is unavailable. OH MY GOD! Well. The bartender comes over and tries to help for several minutes. Manager STILL hasn't come out to me. When he finally did, he was useless. Now I see why the staff hasn't been properly trained. He does apologize - barely. He attitude was like - oh well, what can I do. He had nothing to say to me, charged us full price for our experience, and didn't care that it was our first visit and we weren't coming back.

I left a message every day for 3 days and never got a response. I ended up having to drive 45 minutes to order my jacket that my school specifically requested. 

Upon ordering in person, they told me it would be shipped to my school and be there before my white coat ceremony (2 weeks later). The day before, I called to check the status and they said they were planning on shipping it late in the week. So I had to drive another 45 just to pick it up so I had it for my ceremony. 

While there, I ordered a second coat and asked for it to be shipped to me directly so I wouldn't have to drive. He told me he understands and it would not be a problem if I paid an extra $5. During the transaction, he decides to take a phone call and walks off for 2 minutes while I stand there. He comes back to complete the transaction while speaking on the phone. I understand he's a busy guy but he needs to learn to put calls on hold. 

I get a call 2 days later saying it's ready for me to pick up.. it took me another two days to finally reach the guy again where he tells me the $5 is for embroidering, NOT for shipping (he never mentioned an extra embroidering cost and I didn't pay one for my first coat). We were able to compromise and he will ship it to my school.

3305317,0,1,DN_iNGUat-3HHJHCf495Xg,"So looked forward to the opening..which seemed to take forever. The bar was not extended from the previous restaurant,  so it is small. The bartender JACKIE is quite friendly, and always smiles!!!  The happy hour margaritas are delicious, although the tequila menu is sparse -- adequate. There is no wifi so you can't even 'check - in' which certainly would help with their advertising and marketing. What is the deal? 

For a place named SENOR SALSA you might think the salsa would be fantastic. Quite  disappointed as it falls flat, and almost tasteless like a jarred salsa. Very little garlic or cilantro. No salsa bar???? 

Finally, sat in the main dining room with a friend who prefers tables to bar seating. The waitress was miserable. It was early and there wasn't even a full house. Food is good, tortillas heavy and tasteless but i found out that bottled hot sauces are on the table which helped tremendously with the salsa. I like the mole; the pork and chicken dishes were good. 

Parking stinks. I am sure if the lot designer had put spots on angles they could get at least 6-10 more cars in the lot. The side entry is not quite welcoming. 

All in all just ok. Certainly go because it's close, I like the bartender, but probably wouldn't take anyone there to show them a good time!

It didn't have a plastic texture consistently. And it was spicy but anyways. I paid and took a seat near the window. I got a taste of the rice first and it was very good. Not over cooked and under cooked just right. The cabbage was steamy and good. Finally the chicken the main event. The chicken was dark meat so it wasn't dry.

I started to give a 4 star review but I switched to 5 bc honestly, for a restaurant in it's category it was really good...and a good value.  
Sis and I split the chicken fajitas.   We opted for the portion for ""one"" to split.  (They have a choice of fajitas for 2).  It was sooo much food.  The chicken was tender and seasoned perfectly.  The rice was good and refried beans were also good.  So glad we didn't order more food than that.  The complimentary nacho chips are delicious and we liked the salsa as well.

For people who live or work in that area, I can see that it is in a pretty prime location, directly across from Abington Hospital, right next to where all the shopping starts and not too far from the residential neighborhoods. So, the location is great for anyone in Abington. 

We were warmly greeted by the host who brought us to our table immediately, and before I could even open my menu, a server arrived with a warm bowl of nachos and and a separate bowl of salsa. They didn't skimp either - both were pretty deep. The strawberry margarita was delicious and also huge. 

I ordered the fried chicken chimichanga entree. Again, portion size was generous, but I thought it was a little bland. It wasn't terrible, it just seemed like the chicken wasn't as flavorful as I would expect.

Our server was attentive at first but after we got our meal, she seemed to disappear for longer stretches of time and the restaurant didn't seem to be any more or less busy than when we got there. Which was fine at first, but we waited a little longer than I thought was necessary for the check. She promptly apologized upon taking care of us and made sure we had everything we needed or wanted otherwise.

One of the things I like about this restaurant are the hours, most of restaurants close on Sunday at 9 but this restaurant closes at 10pm. It is nice to know that señor Salsa Is open until 10pm because if we have a late night craving we can always comer. The service is fast and the chips and salsa come as soon as you sit down. 

The drinks are okay they could be a little stronger but it is not too bad. I ordered the burrito supreme and it was good but not the best I ever had. It is tasty and the portion size is good. My fiancé ordered a chicken quesadilla and it was really big and she couldn't finish it and we had to take the rest home.

We met with Edie at an open house for our wedding venue in November. She had some big clients so we were impressed with her resume, and after we finished talking, she said SHE would reach out to us when things were quieting down. We greatly appreciated when her team contacted us 2 weeks later and we set up an appointment for a Saturday 2 months later.

On Thursday, 2 days before our meeting, I had no contact with them since setting up the appointment so I personally called to confirm if it was still on. They did NOT reach out earlier to us. Her team had told us specifically that ""they were overbooked"".   I set up another appointment later but I had to cancel due to a work emergency. I let them know I was disappointed in the earlier cancellation (in which I would have driven 2 hours in 4"" of snow, if I didn't have the insight to call ahead).

What I got subsequently was a personal voicemail, from who I presume was Edie herself, alluding that I was rude to not have the insight that she had a personal emergency and that I needed to put myself above her loved one. LET US RECAP. Her team did not reach out to me to begin with, and when I did it myself, they gave me a different excuse. A personal emergency is ALWAYS more important and we would have understood immediately if that is what we were told in the first place.

I'm sure the team and Edie are lovely people, but there are some communication issues that need to be addressed.",cAuZbjMLflRq0eYG_T_Pfw,1.0,2017-01-13 16:03:58,fe_BXECzFKOMAoC3yIIz-A,3,2017-01-13 16:03:58

Omg what total shit on a plate n the margarita was so so horrible! Our waitress came over n asked ok honestly how are the drinks? I said honestly this is really bad. My friends' drink was just as equally worse.  I got a margarita and my friend a long island ice tea. My margarita tasted like watered down everything. I asked for no silver tequila ! I specifically asked for1800 . On my bill it even had silver on it for 12.00. Hers was beyond gross. She returns wth 2 new ones n they're just slightly doctored but still same. Wtf! Can't even explain that screw up. I got carnitas and friend got chimichangas refried beans liquified on the plates with cheese melted onto it,  the meat tasted like it was in a crock pot zero flavor. I only ate 2 nibbles of meat n cabbage n rice on a flour tortilla n stopped. The chips n salsa they initially put on the table, the salsa was water n I think that's where I got sick.

But maybe others were complaining and someone listened. The food is actually pretty good now, to the point where we're ok going there when we have that need and are in that neighborhood.

The NOISE is another thing, though. I almost ordered two chicken flautas last time just so I could stick them in my ears. It's nearly unbearable and is one of the restaurants on my mental list of my unwritten project: ""Why Are Some Restaurants Unbearably Loud While Others Are Library Quiet?"" 

The chicken empanadas are apparently a permanent offering but not always advertised. Two come with the order and as an appetizer, they are wonderful and huge when not overcooked, as can happen sometimes.

I certainly never walk out hungry. Five stars is out of the question and four stars is pushing the rating a bit but three is not quite enough. BYOP*

I always dread going to a new mechanic for any reason. I am a young woman with plenty of car knowledge who is not looking to be hassled with.

Tom and Sons was amazing. No fuss. No hassle. Let me repeat that...they were AMAZING!! My car got a proper inspection, Tom was very kind and gentlemanly and did not try to make up some nonsense to scare me into buying things for my car that don't need fixed. I cannot recommend them enough for anyone but if you are a woman in the area who is afraid to take her car to the mechanic for fear of being hassled with, don't go anywhere else! Stop looking and just take it to Tom. You will never need to go to another mechanic again. He will treat you with respect and honesty. I created a yelp account specifically to write this review.

The soup was lukewarm and was missing the tangy flavor. I wanted to ask for a lime because thats what normally comes with the soup but our waitress never came to back until I complained about something missing from my entree 

The pollo loco stated on the menu that it comes with chicken with lettuce, guacamole, and sour cream along with 2 sides. My platter was missing the lettuce, guacamole, and sour cream. Because I couldn't find our waitress, I had to tell another server the issue. He stated the entree either came with 2 sides OR the lettuce, guacamole, and sour cream. I had to show him the menu that said the platter says it comes ""WITH"" lettuce, guacamole, and sour cream. He still disagreed and said he'll talk to the server and come back. I was trying to take a picture of the menu and he snatched it away as I was taking the picture! He came back with lettuce and left with the menu.

3393888,2,6,TfVFy5ZjbMIyxTjUNGJx4A,"We came here on a Saturday night around 7, and the parking lot was packed; so was the restaurant. This was my first time here, although I used to live in this area several years ago and it was a seafood restaurant called ""InFlight"" at that time. They were rarely busy when I went in back then. Jump to last night...

First of all, let me just say that after living in California for 28 years, this was the best Mexican restaurant I've found that's comparable to what I was used to.  As I said, the place was packed. We found an empty table by the bar and ordered frozen margaritas while waiting to be seated in the dining room. The wait was about 30 minutes. Not bad considering.  Meanwhile, the margaritas were spot on. Had a pleasant buzz by the time we were escorted to the table. Within a few minutes, a busser arrived with nice warm chips and salsa. The chips are made in-house and served with salsa. Each table has four bottles of hot sauce (mild, medium, chipotle and habanero) in case you want to adjust the heat.  Our waitress, Janine came to the table within 5 minutes and for the entire time we were there, she was pretty attentive and brought everything we ordered in a timely manner.

WHAT WE ORDERED.
Okay, so we started off with a side of guacamole and some more chips. Several minutes later, a man (I'll call him the Guac Guy) came over with a tray consisting of two fresh avocados, a several ramekins, each with fresh fixins for the guacamole, a mortar and pestle, and a tip jar...  Don't worry, we took care of him   ;-) 

For the main course, my dining companion ordered fish tacos, and I ordered a Combo consisting of a hard-shell beef taco and chicken enchilada. Both meals came with rice and refried beans.  Everything was delivered hot, in a timely manner... and delicious. All of it. There was plenty of guacamole to dip the chips and still have enough to add to the entrees. We were both too full to try out any of the deserts, so I'll have to review desert next time. Oh, and there will DEFINITELY be a next time.

THE AMBIANCE
The interior of the place was like being transported to Mexico. The lighting was just right, not too dim, not too bright, with soft red and blue colored lights. Fully stocked bar, HD TVs in the bar area, Lots of people, all age groups represented. Friendly staff. The room is festively decorated with pictures and sculptures of Mexican themed objects such as a giant mortar and pestle filled with guacamole, a 3-D rendering of bulls that appear to be charging through the wall and, behind our table, a big picture window over a brick ledge with a sculpture of Atlas, who appears to be supporting the ledge on his shoulders. 

OVERALL
Overall, it was a perfect evening and a perfect meal. I  can't wait to go back and do it again!

IN CLOSING...

I don't live in the area but was recommended Tom n Sons for their great service so I drove out of my way and it was well worth it! I actually had to reschedule AND was 10-15 min late to my rescheduled appointment AND STILL got great service (sorry again! Traffic I swear lol)! I pulled up, was greeted right away, and although I was late, my car was still taken to be looked at right away. The inspection took maybe 15-20 mins and was $30. I was helped by a gentleman named Julien and he did an exceptional job, I highly recommend asking for him by name. After the inspection I asked him a few questions about my car, an entirely new type of Honda, a 2018 HRV, and despite my car only being about a year old, he was very knowledgeable and helpful with everything I asked. Not only did I feel comfortable in being able to ask anything about my fairly new car, I also felt confident that he knew what he was talking about when he gave me any answers. Overall it was a pleasant experience and I'd recommend anyone get their inspection and all other services done here. Thanks again!

*HeadsUp* ~ There isn't exactly a seating area. There's maybe one chair outside to sit on near the garage, so if you schedule it during a time of hella heat you might want to not stay there. I got lucky that it was still okay around 11am so I sat in the chair and 15 minutes zoomed by no problem but if there's more than one person waiting there, one might end up standing around in heat near a garage/gas station so even if the service is done quickly it might be worth relocating to wait.

3451576,0,3,HTOpL8vIRUjfTbI5WCokYA,"We were given a gift certificate to this place, so we tried to utilize every penny of the $50. 
To start: we got cheese dip and tableside guacamole. I know the dirty little secret of all Mexican places in the area.. The cheese dip is made with processed American cheese, usually Land O'Lakes. Senor Salsa is no different. It was a big, gooey bowl of melted American. It congeals into a weird blob as it cools. Not worth ordering, IMO. The guacamole was good, for the most part. The man preparing at our table asked if we wanted to omit any ingredients, so I asked for no jalapeno, as I wanted to give my baby some. He added jalapeno anyhow. As far as portions go, it was a lot of guac, but rightfully so at almost $8. 
Meals: my husband and I both had a combination platter with a taco, enchilada, chile relleno, tamale, beans, and rice. Initially, we couldn't even eat our food. No silverware on the table and the waitress took about five minutes to check in with us after kitchen staff delivered our meals. When we finally ate? The taco shell was soggy. The tamale had almost no filling. The beans lacked any real flavor. Only thing we really enjoyed was the enchilada and the rice was good. 
My son ordered chicken fingers and fries (can't expect much else from a 9-year-old, I guess.) His meal didn't come out for a full ten minutes after mine and my husband's food was delivered to our table. We ate what we could enjoy, but our plates remained mostly full with undesirable food.

3456071,0,9,NfaMDSZcVnx8CPx0uUfZdg,"My husband and I came here on their second night. At a restaurant that had been open longer, I would be giving two stars because of the service problems, but I'm willing to forgive some issues at a place that's still so new.

We decided to try this place on a whim. First problem: the parking lot is WAY too small to accommodate even a 3/4 full restaurant. There's no real other place to try and go either. We got majorly lucky that we didn't have to circle a few times. Although we got seated right away, it took a really long time before anyone noticed us. To the point where you consider going up to the front podium for a manager, or just walking out. Again, a big problem at an established place, but more forgivable on night two.

The menu is definitely comprehensive, and you'll find all your Mexican classics. But here's the rub: this place will nickel-and-dime you to death. Want more chips? That's a $1. Want more salsa? Was a side of sour cream? Want to split a dish? Want certain refills? Alllll extra. Little fees all over the menu. Not ideal. I can't think of a single GOOD Mexican place that charges for another basket of chips or a small side of sour cream. They also have a $10 debit/credit minimum.

That all being said, we did enjoy the meal on the whole. For about $45 (before tip), my husband and I each got a soft drink, the queso fundido (the chorizo in it was tasty, but the cheese was a little runny for my husband's liking); a 3-part combo with rice, two taquitos, and an enchilada; a 2-part combo with rice and two chicken quesadillas; a side of sour cream (extra $1) and the sopapilla desert. The sopapilla was a little flatter and tougher than I'd have liked, but it wasn't bad. I thought the enchilada was good, and the taquitos were quite delicious. It was definitely more than enough food. If we were to do it again, we'd do the items a la carte and skip the totally average rice.

I'm willing to give this place another try, despite the really slow service and the 'nickel-and-dime the customer' attitude. I wasn't really in the mood to try diving into their apparently extensive tequila list that night, but that could be worth going back for in-of-itself.

It was about 12pm and the dining room was about half filled.  Not bad for a new place.  I say new place but it's a known quantity for those of us in the region paying attention as it's the sister restaurant to the Las Magaritas establishments in Southampton and North East Philly.

If you've been to those, then Senor Salsa should make you right at home.  Decor, menu and specials are all the same.  That's not necessarily a bad thing. Is this the best mexican I've had?  No. But it's not bad and about as authentic as most American pallets can tolerate.  If you want something more authentic, head to Hatboro and sneak out some of the smaller establishments there. 

The food was good.  I had tex-mex in a fajita. It was fresh and well cooked.  Light on the spice compared even to the Las Magaritas sister restaurants. Even the chips were lighter on the salt. This maybe due to being across from Abington Memorial Hospital. You have to adjust for your target market.  With a soft drink, I got out for lunch for about $10.

3496405,0,0,9ThH3sbTKDj4gtEfJhC8KA,"Four years ago, my wife was in the market for a new car. Her Jeep Wrangler was a gas guzzler and her new long commute to work meant her Jeep was no longer an ideal solution. She ended up going to Sloane Toyota and traded in her Wrangler for a new car. Her salesman, Don Kim, was amazing. No pressure but was all about working with us on the deal that was right. He was a big part of the experience, and we ended up getting a brand new Prius C. My wife was instantly in love.

She was so in love with the car, in fact, that a month later I ended up trading in my old Saturn Aura for a used Prius V.  While Don was not available that day I dealt with another sales person (Bill) who was excellent to deal with as well. My car was a 2012 with only 37,000 miles on it. It was a beauty -- and I only lived two miles from the dealership, so getting the car serviced and getting oil changes was a breeze.  And then I moved 35 miles away and thought that my days with dealing with Sloane were over.

Flash forward to yesterday. Even though I moved and there are other Toyota dealerships closer to me, I stopped in for a ""vacation special"" that Sloane was offering (a synthetic oil change, full multi-point inspection and tire rotation) as we were going to take a road trip this weekend. But with the weather lousy we canceled the trip -- I kept the appointment anyway.  A couple weeks ago Sloane had called me saying they were interested in my Prius V. While I wasn't interested in selling at the time it did get me thinking.  I had wanted to move ""up"" to a car with AWD but not lose the beneficial mileage I get with a Hybrid.  I love the RAV4 Hybrid but always considered it to be out of my price range.

Well, Don Kim, and the sales manager Jeff, would not have any of that.  They worked with me, and worked with me some more. And then they ended up working with me even more. At the end of the day I drove out of there with a brand new RAV4 Hybrid at the exact price that I could afford. They were absolutely amazing in their ability and desire to work with me.  No matter how far I move away from Sloane they will be my dealership for life.

I just wonder if my old Prius V got its oil changed...",C45AK9qoM6WbT2WOm4K1Lg,5.0,2018-07-26 12:07:02,V0RkSHN5nckzO6oPTCp6mw,0,2018-07-26 12:07:02

I bought in one huge trash bag, and they ended up taking only 12 items. They only offered me about $27 for everything. Some of their pricing was reasonable. $2 for something old from Forever 21 was okay with me, but $4 for something practically brand new from Abercrombie/VS felt like a rip off. 

I sold it to them anyways because I really needed to get rid of my clothes, but I feel like they could've offered a little more. 

Also, I'm not sure who decides what to buy, because they did miss some gems from Urban Outfitters, rarely worn distressed white denim shorts, and new cardigans!! Their loss! Haha

Everyone is complaining about the smell, but hello??? Have you never been to a thrift store before? It smells like that in all of them!! 

Most of the clothes they are selling aren't really in style, but you can find some good stuff if you really take the time to look. They have a whole rack of Free People items.

It was clear from the visit and conversation that they knew what they were doing and had a plan to execute.

Scheduling was prompt and easy, they gave me a ride to my office after I dropped it off on the day of installation, and communicated clearly with me about what sort of time frame to expect.

I picked it up later the same day and my SUV looked great!  They did a great job, were again... very friendly and professional... explained to me how they did the job and answered my questions clearly.

I will comment on the ER as that is what I have visited first. 
Since they became a trauma center, the ER has been exceptional in the service it provides. 
You should be in and out within a few hours. 
My last experience, I went in with a very high fever. I did not know it at the time. I just knew I felt awful and was light headed (no wonder with a 103 temp.). 
They did not rush to admit me. They took my temp and brought me back immediately in the huge maze of the ER at Abington. I got IV fluids quickly and they periodically checked my temp. I got a shot of ibuprofen of some kind that was supposedly better than over the counter. Within an hour, my temperature was down. 
I've been to area ER's not as efficient over the years. For sickness and sprains, etc. 
A bonus is the free valet parking. You just drive up to the ER they take the car and park it for you. When you are sick, like I was it is very welcome. 

I also must point out, I do know a nurse in the ER. Although, she has never treated me. Whenever I have been there and she has she will check in and say I saw you were here. (She is a motherly type and her reputation proceeds her as several people who know her get the same treatment from her.) The ER is massive so she must see the name in the computer system.

One of the worst cases, being after a year of amateur relaxers, poor diet and a botched relaxer job at another salon,  I walked in with my shoulder length hair breaking off in the back, naps from the center of my head going towards the back and I walked out of there with a bob out of a magazine that stopped everybody in the salon and out in their tracks.  My hair has been growing healthily ever since.  What I appreciate about Lisa is that instead of suggesting I hack it all off like usual hairdressers, she worked with me and gave me suggestions I would feel comfortable with.  

Lisa and the rest of the staff are all very punctual, friendly and professional.  Nobody is ever waiting for a stylist for more than 20 minutes.

As it would happen, they only accepted a few CDs and gave me my two bags of clothing back, saying it ""looked too worn and faded."" I'm curious if perhaps my clothes wore themselves out while sitting in my dresser drawer?

So- as stacey b. wrote, I would agree that their standards for purchasing is really out of whack. While they went through my stuff, I walked around the store and was in disbelief at the random crap they HAD accumulated- a trippy paisley button up straight from the 70s, a patchwork sweater akin to what my grandmother wears, an obviously fake louis vuitton bag, shiny satin shorts, etc. etc. etc.

No high pressure. No up-sell. No complaining that it was too old. One person took the old one to see if it was still functional for re-keying (no). The other searched for a new one with the same dimensions and form.

Ten minutes later I have a new replacement.

It seemed very busy New Year's Eve, phones were ringing nonstop. I called in to ask what time they were closed, and the woman responded, ""I don't know."" Odd answer, so I followed up with ""You don't know what time you close?"", to which she responded ""Nope."" And that was it. I was only 10 minutes away, so I just went in to place my order. 

Upon arriving, I placed my order with a man, and that man also made my pizza and plain steak.  I guess the woman left for the evening.

20-25 minutes later, my food was done and I got to enjoy it piping hot. I found the pizza very good and ate more slices than I care to admit. The plain steak was a bit bland (lack of cheese was a factor), but the roll was soft.  Plain fries were good though, typical.

I would re-order the pizza from here, so give it a try if you're tired of the chain pizzas.

The store itself can feel a little overwhelming. There's just so much stuff for such a small space. The upside is the prices are awesome, the selection and quality is great, and there is a nice variety in styles, brands, and sizes.

She did not wash her hands or use gloves.  The doctor didn't show his face until we had been there for over two (2) hours.  We were told it was due to a ""change in shifts"".  The doctor was rude and arogant and told me he had been there since 6:00 a.m., had no lunch, and was busy with patients who were dying.  He kept taking phone calls in the middle of talking and would disappear for more than 20 minutes. My daughter asked for one Motrin for pain and the nurse never gave it to her.  A patient's pain should be managed while being evaluated.  The nurse never asked her what her pain level was.  After over three hours of this B.S. I demanded that the IV be removed from my daughter's arm and that the doctor write the prescriptions so that we could finally leave.

3921982,0,0,rzgHrfytTAAG5cGJeq1gYQ,I went to this place for the first time last week and seen a lot of cute stuff. I found the items to be in pretty descent to just ok conditions. Basically what I would expect the items to look like. Some where more worn than others but with a little care and washing I said it's worth the prices. On the flip side they just started buying/selling children's clothing. So I brought in some of my daughters and son's gear to sell. Let me tell you they took 4 items! Everything in my bag was in excellent condition and a few had the tags still on it. One item in particular (gap jacket) my daughter literally wore one time and because there was a microscopic spot on it they wouldn't except it. I didn't even see the spot until she pointed it out! All in all I donated most of the items to a church and received $8 for the 4 items they kept. Nice place to shop but will never waste my time again selling items!,yY8ZNfEggNGWfMyuXyjfZw,3.0,2012-02-27 20:47:10,VSjr31smfUO489VzyYWyQg,0,2012-02-27 20:47:10

Part of shopping consignment is the thrill of the hunt and the delight of the great find. Well, at Pooh's Corner, it's more like hunting for a needle in a haystack.

The store is bursting at the seams with stuff. There are racks of clothes and piles of gear; toys jammed into shelves and linens falling to the floor. If you want to backtrack, you have to loop the whole store and start over. There's no walkway, no room to browse, and heaven forbid there's another shopper in the store at the same time. It's overwhelming; there's just too much junk.

The price tags are color-coded and the shopkeeper will tell you which are half off and which are full price. Not everything is tagged, so be prepared for some off-the-cuff price quotes. 

The first time I went in, I thought they were temporarily overstocked. I've visited several times, and its always like this. With all that stuff, you'd think I would find something I wanted.

We all agreed that we would figure that out when we got there , to our surprise the resturant looked like a bungalow nestled among trees and children riding bikes out front. We had to park in the rear of the resturant, it started to get dark and there was very little lighting provided in the parking lot.  So we walk around front and walked into a restaurant with one table that looked like they grabbed it at a yard sale. They had refrigerators full of sodas  and frozen food lining the back wall, and a open see thru kitchen, thankfully so we could watch them prepare our food. Did I mention no one even greeted us coming thru the door or while standing at the counter. We ordered two pizzas 1 cheese and pepperoni and 1 plain cheese and I wanted the falafel to  try because every pregnant woman wants one. After ordering we sat at the makeshift table (luckily no one else had come or they would have to stand), and waited.   My family and I waited about 25 minutes for our food, while entertaining ourselves.We failed to look at the food until we made it home (something we will never do again) so from smell alone it should have been good. But we were So disappointed,  the pizza was thin with freezer burnt pepperoni , and absolutely no sauce on the pizza. I have never been so disappointed  in pizza , pizza is really hard to mess up. My falafel was cold and mushy, with soggy lettuce and tomatoes on a stale pita bread.

3939029,0,18,CT9jxuzKByTUwtr4VwRP6w,"If you are pregnant - especially in the 2nd trimester or earlier- AVOID the ER here if you have complications or suspect a problem.

I went here at 15+ weeks pregnant because I was having contractions. A RESIDENT saw me in the ER- my advice is to always ask to see someone actually on hospital staff and NOT a resident. Her name was Jennifer Weidner- AVOID her!

She refused to send me up for an ultrasound and fetal monitoring. She did not take my complaint of contractions seriously. She sent me home - telling me to take Tylenol. They had taken blood samples (which I found out later were not tested- had they been, they would have seen elevated platelets and white blood cells - as we're discovered as I was miscarrying- but before I bled). They also took a urine sample. All they did with that urine sample was do a pregnancy test (even though they heard the heartbeat and I had been at AMH the week before for an ultrasound).

I was back in the ER a few hours later half-delivering my dead baby. Again I had to deal with Jennifer Weidner - long story short she almost sent me home AGAIN prematurely (telling me to ""monitor my symptoms and to come back if they worsened"")- thank GOD at this point 2 competent OBs were called in, told Jennifer Weidner that if she sent me home I could have hemorrhaged and required a blood transfusion later. They also mentioned she had scheduled me for a D&E later that day at 2pm - which was never told to me nor my husband. After my D&E, I was wheeled out to the curb and that was it. No mention of what happened to my son's remains, no option for testing, no grief counseling (although I was clearly crying heavily and in shock).

After this debacle, I requested my medical records and also noticed errors and discrepancies in them. I had to go back and advocate for myself so many times and do my own research. It made a very difficult time even worse.

I will say the nurses were fantastic- very supportive and sympathetic. Also, the actual OBs also seemed knowledgeable. 

Just beware that if you go to the ER you will see a resident- and I would recommend asking to see an experienced doctor. Or, actually, AVOID this ER altogether and find a non-teaching hospital in the area.",puGcZz5LWtXc0bzvfQHoxw,1.0,2013-10-20 06:16:58,zI6G-lDku9ARhIvMV-l2sg,2,2013-10-20 06:16:58

Now nothing works again. Its very dangerous to drive since we cant see how fast the car is going or the lights doesnt even work.Instead of helping us, they told us to contact the CEO.

4054331,1,8,8NEvWCbYeuefCYdqo1ElOQ,"I did like the Closet Exchange up until exactly one week ago. I had purchased a Louis Vuitton Neverfull MM bag in the monogram print for $285.14, I was told it was authentic due to the date code, and the fact it was ""real leather."" Upon further inspection (after I bought it) I noticed some flaws in the authentication of the bag. The date code didn't match up with the ""made in..."" tag, and the date code also didn't match up with the year it was supposedly made. When I started questioning authenticity I resorted to asking people online and they all agreed that it was a fake due to the heat press, fonts, date code, coloring after oxidizing, etc. so before returning it I took it to the LV in KOP and compared it and there were some small differences and some big. I understood each are slightly different depending on year, but these were differences that had absolutely nothing to do with year. I took it back to the store and they would only initially refund me $104 in cash and the rest ($184.17) in store credit because apparently the system can't refund debit or something. She later said she would do $200 in cash (which makes no sense since she said it was the system that wouldn't allow it) and the rest in store credit but that's still $85.17 that is put towards a company I no longer want to support. Pretty annoyed. They are basically just trying to make more profit off of a bag that is fake (the bag was confirmed AS A REPLICA by Memes Treasures, Melissa Knape.) However the manager of the store had said that even with an an authenticity slip stating whether it was real or fake wouldn't change her mind on actually refunding me the full amount without store credit. I kept the bag, because I'm not letting them profit anything else off of me. I just wish that I had seen these things before I purchased the bag, but again that is my fault.

4127827,0,2,1dsYZt9FbddDsbZM0pbZkg,"We have 4 Toyotas and had been going to Sloane in Glenside, PA, for service for 15 years.  We have spent thousands and thousands there.   Everything seemed fine.  Then late last year, we had a very bad experience with the Service Dept.  We took our car in on a Monday for service.  It needed an inspection, a new manifold and possibly some tires if needed for the inspection.  They said it would be ready Tuesday or Weds.  Then they said on Weds they needed to drive the car and test it out but there was no one available who could drive a standard shift.  After 2 more days of delay because ""no one at Sloane could drive it"", we finally got our car back very late on Friday.  That was not our usual experience getting service in the past.

It was dark and raining when my 72-year old husband picked it up.  He did not see any new tires as he walked around the car before he drove off but he was tired and the light was bad.  On Saturday/Sunday, the car sat in our driveway.  We were in and out of the driveway all day both days with moving trucks.  Late Monday my husband sat down to look at the service invoice and realized that they HAD charged him for new tires and an alignment and a disposal fee for 2 old tires.  So he went out to admire the new tires in the daylight, but again, he saw only the 4 old tires.  His original impression had been correct.  He wasn't upset.  He just assumed they just made an honest mistake and would fix it tomorrow.

He went back to Sloane the next morning and told James, his service manager, about the problem.  James immediately called over Richard Rozzelle, the service manager.  Richard went out to the car with my husband and looked at the 4 original tires we had on the car.  Then, much to my husband's surprise, he declared that they had made no mistakes.  He insisted they had put on 2 new tires and had aligned them and disposed of the old ones.  My husband asked how did he know?  He said because that was what was printed on the invoice.  Couldn't the invoice be wrong, my husband asked?  NO, said Richard.  It could NOT be wrong.  Couldn't they have made an honest mistake and forgotten to get the tires on as intended?  NO, said Richard.  No mistakes had been made.  The work had been done as invoiced.  Period. 

When my husband pointed out how absurd that was, given that the same 4 matching original old tires were still on the car, he just shrugged and said slyly that ""something must have happened to them.""  He said he had checked his tire inventory and it was correct.  So, it couldn't be Sloane's fault the new tires ""were now missing"".  He said he saw my husband look at his car when he picked it up.  (This seemed significant to him.)  My husband explained he was looking for the new tires but didn't see them and just thought he missed them.  When Richard was asked how did he explain our magical ability to get the original matching old tires BACK onto the car since Sloane had supposedly disposed of them?  He just shrugged and said he didn't know.   Basically, he was implying we were doing something fraudulent.  He didn't explain what exactly or how.  He just would not credit us OR do the work we paid for but we were now missing. Then he looked at the invoice again and said it looked like we were only charged for 1 new tire but he knows, somehow, that we received 2 new ones.  So he said we were lucky to have gotten a tire we didn't actually pay for.  So NOW the invoice COULD BE wrong?  The whole episode was all very confusing to us after being faithful customers for 15 years and trusting our cars to Sloane.

We tried to see the General Manager, Jeff Lish, but he was not in so we wrote an e-mail to him and explained our problem.  We were headed out of town for the holidays the next day but we told him we would call him when we returned to the area after the holidays.  We called and left messages twice in January but we received no return calls.  Our e-mail was unanswered.

Today, we just got one of our other cars serviced at Thompson Toyota in Doylestown.  They did several major repairs in just over 24 hours.  We had an EXCELLENT service experience at Thompson.  Very clear communication and good customer care.  We also saw that a long-term Sloane service employee is now working there and heard that many new Ambler-area customers have been flocking there.  Not surprised.  We still aren't angry about what happened.  It was just an honest mistake.  But the inappropriate response to a long term customer was completely baffling.  The fact that Richard could not admit the mistake and the General Manager did not acknowledge our letter suggests that things are not working well at this location.  So, we will not be returning to Sloane Toyota of Glenside, PA, for obvious reasons.  We just wanted to let you know about our bad experience as a cautionary tale.   But the good news is that there ARE other good options out there.",C45AK9qoM6WbT2WOm4K1Lg,1.0,2019-07-20 04:26:21,v3GJJBe7Mclj9a9slP1zjg,0,2019-07-20 04:26:21

4204305,2,6,ilVQotuDNeMr02Ei1Q9Qkg,"The Vintage is a nice tavern spot on 611, in an area pretty devoid of good tavern spots. It would be popular just for that reason, but thankfully it's actually a pretty great joint.

On the restaurant side, the food is pretty outstanding. It's a lot of standard tavern fare, but you get some creative items on the menu as well. It's actually a pretty extensive menu, but a lot of it is just creative takes on common things (they have about a thousand different sandwiches, for example). My personal favorite is the buffalo chicken sandwich, which is a common tavern item, but here at Vintage they make it amazing. The buffalo sauce is just right, the chicken is tender and well cooked, and it all comes together perfectly. Easily the best buffalo chicken sandwich I've ever had.

While I haven't had that many things on the menu, I've come here often and brought enough people, and I can say with confidence nobody has ever been disappointed in their food. Is this five-star restaurant fare? Well no, but it's the best you'll find at a tavern for this price. The only drawback is the service can be spotty when it comes to the restaurant.

Come dark, Vintage is significantly more of a bar scene. Being close to Abington hospital, you get a lot of hospital staff coming off shift. The bartenders are all fantastic, make great drinks, and are fast and responsive. The owners are great guys, always sitting at the bar chatting and having drinks. If you go to Vintage a couple times, you're almost guaranteed to see them... but you probably wouldn't even know they own the place. Despite it's popularity, it's still a pretty small and tight-knit scene and if you go enough, soon everyone will know your name, Cheers-style.

Definately give it a shot... especially since it's one of the only viable options for a sports bar and tavern in Abington.",sNOzfwyTZDwKtMiTwjQobA,5.0,2010-07-08 01:38:00,VEPhkkKyYQzOWyfHQ2wCgg,2,2010-07-08 01:38:00

We moved to Elkins park about 3 months ago and are big Thai fiends - I had a Thai exchange sister when I was growing up and have never looked back. This was maybe our 4th Thai restaurant, and we hadn't thought any of the other three were good enough for a repeat (I do not remember their names).

As a family we have purchased quite a few things that I got to try and I thought everything was good or great.

Good:
Apps - potstickers, crispy rolls (probably the least favorite thing I tried, lacked flavor)
Entrees - beef fried rice, rama curry

Great: 
Apps - satay, corn fritters, thom ka soup (full of veggies and chicken), thai iced tea
Entrees - massaman curry (everyone's fav), pad thai, vegetarian basil 

It's not a place that's going to make you wonder what you've been missing your whole life but it's consistently good traditional Thai food with good service, good prices, and I especially love that I never feel like they're skimping on the veggies or meat portions in their entrees and soups.

4251048,0,1,bwAJ3EJ2bBGip7j4H-GPxA,"Amid a local food scene that is heavily weighted towards the trendy and the moment, a little tradition is always welcome.  Levis is as good a place as any in the Philadelphia area to provide this.  Since 1895 this has been the hot dog spot in Philadelphia.  In its current location in Jenkintown, it may lose some of the ambience that it had at its original Society Hill address .... but the food is as good as ever.  To me these tasty all-beef hot dogs are the best in Philadelphia ... maybe the best I've eaten in North America.  I love their consistency and flavor.  And at Levis, you have a choice of so many toppings to enhance them.  Def don't forget to add the Pennsylvania pepper hash.  Also Levis has Horn & Hardarts legendary macaroni and cheese.  I tried it.  It's awesome tasty and different from gastro-pub style mac 'n cheese.  Sometimes they also have potato knishes from Lipkins Bakery.  I told you this place is all about tradition.  And to wash it all down - just say the words Champ Cherry Soda.  This special recipe is another Levis original.  
 
If you're in the area, make it a point to stop in and support Levis.  And you can read about much of Levis's history from the photos and clippings on the walls.  As soon as you bite into a Levis hot dog loaded with toppings, your taste buds will thank you!",1QhVyffaYx6Y_gEtNOQoAA,5.0,2015-10-09 13:54:20,8EMU7d4pCkdqUnvlIW40CA,2,2015-10-09 13:54:20

My boyfriend and I came to the Old Town Buffet this past Saturday. We were going food shopping and decided to eat beforehand. We were going to grab a quick slice of pizza at Peace of Pizza on Old York Rd, but it was closed down! We started driving to try to find a cheap place to eat and we passed the Old Town Buffet. As a joke, my boyfriend said we should eat there. 

I must note that neither of us had been there before and we pretty much knew what we were getting into: nasty food, crowds of people you just do not want to share food with, kids touching everything, etc. but we laughed and went on our way inside. 

It was a large buffet but immediately I knew we were in trouble. Heres the thing-- we are vegetarians! We have been to many buffets over the years that have a nice selection for vegetarians, however this one was a joke. 

There were tons of meat, fish, etc. but no one seemed to be eating any of it. We walked aorund to each section to see what we could force ourselves to eat. On my place: mashed pototaes, vegetable fried rice, corn on the cob, and stringbeans (I think they were actually made out of string.... hmmm...). I thought you could never go wrong with mashed potatoes but HOLY SHIT! They were freezing cold. My small plate was pretty much a disaster and we were saddened when we saw the prices for the garbage (or lack of) that we could not even eat. 

After attempting to pick at a fruit tray, we decided it was time to head out. I said wait, let's grab something from the dessert tray, they cannot mess up there. So I got and brownie and went to the table. I took a bit and I immediately spit it in a napkin. IT WAS MADE WITH TOOHPASTE!!!! I made my boyfriend try it and he said ""let's get the fuck out of here.""

We were in Abington for my sister's championship volleyball game and, after screaming our faces off for an hour and a half (and getting that W!!) found ourselves starving for more than spikes and aces. Yelp steered us in the direction of Vintage, less than a mile away, and we left wishing desperately that this establishment was closer to home.

The sweet waitress brought over some bread and house-made butter (amazing garlicky goodness) before taking our drink orders. Our food orders were taken shortly after, and she didn't hesitate when we asked for more bread (we're carbivores, my family). The food came quickly, our drinks were kept fresh and full, and every check in (from bartender to waitress) was welcome and polite. I enjoyed the broccoli rabe and sausage, a side that very well could've been an entree, a spicy and filling treat. But, since we all need a good #treatyoself day now and then, I indulged in a chalice of INCREDIBLE French onion soup. Seriously, this soup.... I'd put crock-to-crock against any soup in Center City.  I'd love to say I got to enjoy the chips, signature side with most sammies, but my brother and dad DEVOURED them before I even got a chance to snag a few! This probably is higher praise than I might be able to give. They were also elated when we were able to pick and choose the football games playing on the numerous big screens around our table.

When our bill came for the five of us, we were pleasantly surprised at how affordable everything was considering the tastiness factor. The bathrooms were clean and fragrant, there's ample parking, and a darling little back patio that the rain and chill in the air didn't really allow for, but I'd jump at the chance if I was ever in the area again.

The mongolian grill..... uh where do I begin with that.  They had literally 4 pieces of beef on the tray, 10 pieces of broccoli and some mushrooms and onion.  Wow!!!!  The rest of the food, do you really want to know about it??  Everything was drench with oil.  Bit into a eggroll and like a cup full of oil came flowing out.  Really freaking disgusting.  Food is just bad!!!!

Should I mention the patrons too??  Lets put it this way, they were eating while they are scooping the food and the stuff they dont like, they just put back into the food trays......  That my friends was the last straw.   Paid and left.

So looking for a buffet, dont come here.  I'd rather eat Taco Bell and run for the bathroom afterwards instead of coming here!!  Please heed my warnings!!

They were also very knowledgeable about menu items, and about the beer selections. Also, the food is very good too, and the pricing is reasonable especially for the portion size and quality.

4413062,0,2,vMKghbuqGdNbr05xA7h4IQ,"Firstly, I want to point out the ambiance and professionalism of Dr. Patel's office and staff. She runs her practice in a beautiful home turned into an office, which gives a more comfortable feeling from the beginning. Her staff has clearly been trained well from the front office to the hygentist/dental assistants. They are very polite and know their respective jobs inside and out. The hygienist had been in the industry for 27 years and made me feel extremely comfortable. She identified certain issues on my X-rays and educated me on how to prevent future issues. 

I wanted to make sure that I dedicated the second part of my review to Dr. Patel. She is hands down one of the most professional, yet caring dentists I've ever met. I appreciate that she knows how to transition into that fine line of when to get down to business. She knows her industry extremely well, has the newest technologies in her office and ensures that her treatment plans are not ""overkill"" as most dentists typically do. 
For example: I visited an ""In network"" dentist because my insurance covered it and they told me I had $7,500 worth of work to get done. I went to Dr. Patel and she took new X-rays for me and provided me with a treatment plan that was $3,000. Not to mention, she uses much more modern materials for fillings and crowns than other practices.


In all, Dr. Patel's office is my top choice for a dental office. I appreciate that I can go to an office where I trust the diagnosis and work that is being done!",730bVHXxxUl1Z6p_e8DdgA,5.0,2015-12-18 17:02:47,RI0l7m0JGgAC_r1V_RssFw,0,2015-12-18 17:02:47

I give it 4 stars for Abington where it might be only 3 stars in the city.  So I'm a city snob, tough shit.  But in Abington and the surrounding area you have little competition, the Kitchen Bar which used to be OK, now blows, Drakes which was never better than average, and other similar ilk.  So this place will be my new Abington ""go to"" spot.

There was a very nice selection of drafts including 2 or 3 IPA's on tap, 'twas a good start.  The wines by the glass, I was told, were very good, and a nice pour.

Food:  I started with the French onion soup with melted cheese.  The cheese was tasty, the broth was just OK, overall a 3 star starter.  

I followed this up with a black and blue burger, black angus beef with bacon and blue cheese, not a bad element of inclusion in sight, on a nice solid burger bun.  This was the big-ass burger, but with very good flavor bursting through the perfectly grilled outter crust.  This is close to the best burger I've had in years, granted I only have about 4 a year.  Give this mo-fo 4.33 stars.  

My friend ordered the short rib, not sure if this was a special for the evening or on the regular menu...old age and short memory don't always work well when coupled with a handful of brewski's.  Anyway, I cringed when this was ordered at a neighborhood type establishment where you might think it was a stretch, but I turned out to be impressed with the tender, falling apart beef, with little or no fat.   This was better than many other places I've been to which claim to be ""fine dining"" experiences.  Give it 4 stars.

The server was kind, friendly and around when we needed her, and no rush, thank you, to give up the table on a Friday night.

Went on a Friday night, were seated as soon as we got there. Ordered their cajun fries as an App they were very good. Our sandwiches came out quickly both were very good (I had a steak sandwich with onions and cheese and the wife a grilled chicken). Beer menu was very solid, atmosphere was also good. The thing we liked compared to the other places in the area was the value. With our sandwiches we both got tons of their homemade chips and tons of their homemade coleslaw....we've found that around here you generally get short-changed on the sides (at The Drake you just get a pickle with some burgers for the same price). We will certainly come back to Vintage and think you'll agree the food is excellent (the menu is also really vast for a ""burger bar"" type of place) and the value is really worth coming back for.

I happened to be in the area one Friday night, so I used my YELP app to find restaurants nearby.  The reviews of Vintage were good, so I was up for the adventure.

The restaurant was filled, but we were seated within ten minutes of arriving.
Once we were seated, it was ""all hands on deck"" for the service.  Our server, Sally, was very attentive and the manager, and owner (at least he looked like an owner) were helping their staff deliver food and drinks.

Needed a restaurant that has late kitchen hours, found Vintage on Yelp. This was the first time that Yelp has steered me wrong!!!!!!!!!! They're pretty close to my home so I thought I'd give them a try. Walked in to a college frat party complete with loud drunk folks singing and making a ruckus. Seated immediately, there were more folks standing outside than inside, I should have taken that as a sign. Our table was off balance and we spent 5-10 minutes placing various object under the legs to try and make the table stable...it never worked out.  

The menu is huge, that was concerning since a restaurant cannot specialize in ""everything"". I ordered the Filet Mignon sandwich; I should have known something was up when I was not asked how I wanted my steak prepared so I asked for it medium. LMAO, what I received was some type of 'beef' that was overcooked, sliced and mixed with peppers & Onions then topped with cheese.  The fries were either old or cooked in old dirty grease. I managed to eat some of it only b/c I needed something to absorb the alcohol Id consumed while partying that night :)

My honey ordered the pulled pork sandwich, it arrived and it was a huge mound of an almost unrecognizable substance. I guess it was some type of shredded pork product drowning in the thickest darkest BBQ sauce I've ever encountered.  

This place claims to prepare things fresh and from scratch, so I guess our food was prepared fresh then frozen so that it could be served to us a month later. I seriously do not understand how anyone can enjoy the food here.  Everything taste like it was dumped out of a pouch and microwaved. Bland and sloppy is the best way to describe this place.

The potato was flavorless and the dough was thick and heavy and it seemed that the knish was sitting in a steamer all day. Disgusting!  Not at all my memory of what the REAL Levis Hot Dogs were like back in the day.  But the real disappointment was the attitude of the owner who was yelling at the workers and rude to some customers who seemed to be taking a little while to decide.

In my opinion the manager seems to be the one that is picking fights with the employees and can also be snappy with customers. I have also witnessed the establishment being managed by one employee while the manager and other coworkers are smoking on the side of the building. As much as I enjoy Levis, this is most definitely a reason to feel as though I should take my business elsewhere.

On weekends, Vintage is hopping and parking can be a challenge, but do not be deterred.  Vintage has three seating areas:  Outside, the bar area and an adjacent dining room.   We always sit at the huge five-sided  bar because we love the vibe (and the various characters who drift in and out).  

Our favorite items include the gorgeous seafood bisque.   It is far superior to the supposedly famous crab bisque offered by the Porterhouse Pub (up York Road in Peddler's Village)  which is heartburn in a bowl as far as I am concerned.   Vintage's is smooth, luscious and sufficiently filling to be an entree.   We have never been disappointed by a Vintage salad, although my favorite is the Cajun shrimp and chicken Caesar.   The gentle heat of the Cajun seasoned shrimp and chicken is the perfect counterpoint to the rich Caesar dressing.   Meanwhile, Mr. M is a fan of Vintage's burgers and corned beef special, all of which he has gobbled with gusto.

The interior is completely the same (dark, thai wood murals, pretty large) and was entirely empty except for us. I'm thinking its usually empty as when we first entered the restaurant, it took a few minutes for anyone to notice us. Also, if you order carry-out or call without a response, call again, because Ive seen them miss many phone calls while staff were in the back kitchen.

The menu is different from Tien Thai's, offering exclusively thai food (tien thai also included vietnamese cusine) with different menu options and prices.

We started off with the Golden Pouch appetizers which turned out to be crisp, moist, with a delicious plum sauce on the side. We also ordered their thai iced tea which was like any other thai restaurant's - not bad, not exceptional. 

My boyfriend ordered the American Fried Rice, and I the Pad See Ew (drunken noodles) with tofu. We were very underwhelmed with the american fried rice as it was $15 for a plate that had a TINY portion of rice on it (along with a few pieces of fried chicken; theres a picture posted by the owners).. you would think an entree with the word ""fried rice"" in it would make up the bulk of the plate. My partner, as he put it, left ""barely full"" and described it as disappointing in flavor.

The Pad See Ew was plentiful and for a reasonable price of $10. It was a bit bland and more sweet than the drunken noodles I was use to, but for the portion and price, I didnt complain too much.

Overall, it's not likely i would return. I say not likely over never because there aren't many thai restaurants in the abington-jenkintown area and i often have cravings for thai.

Ordered sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving at this location a week before the holiday. Stopped in the day of and it took the staff over 45 minutes to find them. Very disorganized. It would've been easier to wait in the line that was out the door on Thanksgiving to get a side of sweet potatoes. Fast forward to Christmas Eve. I came in for a side of sweet potatoes for Christmas. Was told that, because I didn't order days earlier, they would not allow me to order any sweet potatoes. I asked for a few small sides so that I could take them with me the same day. The ""regional manager"" walked up to the counter and caused a scene because I didn't order in advance. She told me that ""people always wait until last minute and then want people to rush for them"" and that she couldn't help me.  She then told me to sit down and wait an hour since I missed the cut off for ordering sweet potatoes and it would take that long to get them ready. Meanwhile, customers I'm front of me ordered a tub of sweet potatoes for their family meal deal.  I told her I'd take them uncooked if that was easier. She huffed and told me that I could wait and if I didn't like it, I could leave. Didn't realize that this was a big deal due to the fact that ordering in advance actually takes longer to get the food than just walking in and ordering. Especially surprising because all I wanted was a small side of sweet potatoes. Never had this experience at the Lansdale Boston Market.  Was very rude, especially for a regional manager. Between the disorganization when you try to pick up pre-ordered food and the attitudes that you get from the staff and now the regional manager, I will definitely not be returning to this Boston Market again.",5N-93oMmm0MUt8HvyOot5A,1.0,2018-12-25 10:55:32,dyeYHB_7r3nTGqeBVbckOA,0,2018-12-25 10:55:32

The walls have some throwback photos of the hay day of Levis' hot dogs and some older hot dog signs, the old soda fountain is gone and they barely painted over the wording on the walls, which just adds to the dreary feel they have. 

I ordered a hotdog and fries, I had my hot dog garnished with onions and ""pepper mash"". The pepper mash was described to me as ""pickled hot peppers, carrots, cauliflower, etc., which immediately made me think of how I get dogs & roast beef in Chicago (see my review of Portillo's). Unfortunately this was a ground up dry tasteless distraction from the hotdog. What didn't fall off on its own when trying to pick up the dog was quickly jettisoned because it brought nothing to the table. Onto the hot dog itself, this shines by itself and is the redeeming aspect of the visit. The casing is nice and adds a bit of crunch to the dog when biting it. The flavor of the dog is bold and what a hot dog should taste like.  Fries are OK, nothing special. If I found myself here again, I'd get a hot dog by itself and probably try the roast beef.

We went there for dinner, after not going for well over a year.  I ordered the Chinese chopped salad and after taking one bite, realized that the mandarin oranges didn't taste right.  The server came over and I told her this (I didn't yell, raise my voice at all) and she took it back.  A couple minutes later she came back to tell me that the cook AGREED with me and that he thinks they were bad.  He offered to make me another salad but I declined.  When we got the bill they took the salad off and I asked politely if given the circumstances of having ROTTEN food on my plate if maybe they could comp our drinks for the inconvenience.  

WELL HERE IT STARTS - the manager/owner, whoever, came out and RUDELY said, ""We comped your salad, we are NOT taking anything else off."" He then stormed off.  I was really insulted and embarrassed, not by the fact that they wouldn't do this, but how awful he was.  I went up to him and told him how nasty he was and right away he assumes I am not going to pay the bill and THREATENS TO CALL THE POLICE!  Honestly.    He continues to tell me that NOTHING is wrong with the salad (uh, read paragraph above) and that I should never return to his restaurant again.  Didn't need to be told that - it wouldn't happen anyway.

We needed service on our unit today and Vince was our guardian angel.  He arrived promptly with a cheerful and positive attitude.  He spent time looking at the unit and was able to get it up and running.   However instead of just leaving and checking it off his list, he felt that there was some underlying issue that might result in a recurrence of the problem, so he called Lennox up and explained what his concerns were  and they walked him through the diagnostic steps and problem was solved.   I applaud Vinnie for being so knowledgeable and professional that he knew that the first fix would not be permanent and spent the time and effort to make sure that our system would perform well for the long run.

After the duct cleaning, we still noticed several dirty areas in our ducts.  Also, the technician had placed a taped up air filter the wrong way in our furnace (presumably to increase velocity while he was trying to clean the ducts).  Problem is, he left it that way after he finished and it sat like that for a couple of weeks before I went to check it myself.  So all that dust he stirred up in the system and didn't clean out got blown all over the house.  Great.

On the second occasion, my AC stopped working abruptly during a hot period.  Chud was fast and got there the next morning.  Awesome.  The guy had the machine fixed in 2 minutes; the run capacitor was bad.  Total bill was $261, 85 for the service call and 176 for the part.  A quick google search revealed the part is about 8 dollars anywhere on the web.  I called a couple other companies and they said they generally do that repair for about 100 dollars.  Oh, and the air filter was taken out of the furnace and placed diagonally back in and left that way again.  Seriously?

I don't begrudge them making some money on parts as well as service, but a 2200% markup seems to be pretty awful.  When I called to get some satisfaction on that, they simply said ""well, we charge national flat rate and that's your cost.""

On the plus side, the sushi was better than one would expect at a buffet. Lots of variety...and it seemed pretty fresh. I might have given them 2 stars, but the sushi was worth an extra star.

I ate here on a friday night...if I had wanted some snow crab legs, I would have had to sit closer to the buffet...and facing the kitchen door to see when they came out. I never saw any on the buffet during my regular trips...but I did see people waiting patiently waiting for them to come out. I could have gotten some of the dungeness crab, but I left my wooden mallet and jackhammer at home.

Lastly, I thought the price was a bit high, 16.35 with drink. If you are mobile, go to Royal Buffet on City Ave in Philly...cheaper, and better food",BW8AzQxlVK24DBfC0gaaww,3.0,2011-01-24 19:49:49,HzPajDmYW_1hkUuAXJ4dfQ,0,2011-01-24 19:49:49

When it first opened a few years ago it was great, then in 2014 I felt that they weren't trying and had bad service.  I was served a wilted, warm caeser salad which was supposed to be taken off of my check by a rude server-but wasn't, and the food seemed to be ""off', but currently they have gotten the drinks, service and food together.

Drinks are potent and well-made, shaken at your table which I thought was a nice personal touch.  The menu selections are diverse enough for both the adventurous and average taste.   I currently recommend the shrimp burger-something you don't see everywhere; spicy and satisfying while not loaded with calories.  The food was consistently clean & delicious the 3 times this week that I ate here with different people.

Best times to eat here:  11:30 am - 3:30 pm for great service and no wait.  Expect to wait at the bar on weekend nights.

4662039,0,3,OWY2eRODkpyjSsqCMeRdlg,"What an amazing dentist and office!
I like to visit places only after extensive research - they better have good reviews! I hadn't been to a dentist in about three years and I'm not comfortable just going any old place. Dr. Patel's office has rave reviews so I took the chance. 
The moment you walk in the door you experience the beautiful office and ambiance. It's beautiful, clean, and modern. They have a very welcoming waiting room with a loaded fridge of fancy drinks and a nice coffee maker on the counter. A flat screen TV sits on the wall over a fancy fireplace. I was immediately greeted by the receptionist and Judy.
My new patient visit was long, but so in-depth! I've never had such an appointment. Here's the run down:
Judy took me into her office and wrote down all my concerns and some history on a pad. Then she gave me a quick tour of the place, which included their great technology (a crown machine for same-day crowns and a 3D 360 scanner that can see all kinds of things in your head and neck). 
After a quick wait in the waiting room, I was brought to my room and Dr. Patel came in. Judy went over the list with us and then Dr. Patel ask me a few questions and took a peek in my mouth. She ordered the 3D scan and bite wings. 
Renee, the dental assistant, then came in and took me for my scans. We came back and she asked me some questions and explained what the exam would be like.
When Dr. Patel came back, she reviewed all my scans and some notes and then dove into the exam. The exam was lengthy and consisted of feeling around my head and neck with her fingertips to look for trigger points and anything of concern, lots of measure of teeth and of jaw range, inspected my teeth and gums with her instruments, taking photos of my teeth with a small wand. 
She then explained her findings to me and a plan of action. I have a lot that needs work, but they somehow made it seem like no big deal and manageable. 
Then it was back to Judy to schedule my first set of appointments and explain the costs to me. She gave me the worksheet and was in touch the next day to follow up on what we discussed.
I also briefly met the hygienist, Julia, who answered my questions and settled my fears about a deep cleaning. 
Overall, I LOVED my experience and am grateful to every staff member I met for being so kind and professional. You honestly rarely see such kindness and positivity in a clinical setting. I will recommend them to everyone!",730bVHXxxUl1Z6p_e8DdgA,5.0,2018-07-20 19:40:30,2AkZF9XoqwwoPlk55icKMQ,2,2018-07-20 19:40:30

For one, if these guys come out, they do not take off the service call fee- so you have an additional $150 on top of whatever repair that they have. These guys are the ONLY people I know that do that. 

Early in November (a little over a month ago) we get a post card about of complimentary heater servicing; then they charge me $180 for the call. I call their manager and they inform me that they ""sent the cards out by accident."" not my problem- but they knock of half the price. I wouldn't have used them if I was going to be charged because we were selling the house.

They have NO military discount- not that I'm not willing to pay for the service, but usually we get some sort of nod. 

Now, I ask these guys to certify my heater for the sale of my home... they say they won't because it is not safe- the heater has never been serviced; it isn't safe. Excuse me? you didn't say that a month ago with my 3 week old sitting in the living room! You told me to keep the system in place until it breaks.

He stands indicating he can not examine me and told the tech to write that I refused his service. I in turn told him that he would need to include that it was because he refused to wash his hands. He told me that handwashing is a matter of beliefs and opinions. He also asked me did I know about ""normal flora,"" He asked me, ""what about psychiatrists they do not needed to wash their hands because they do not touch their patients."" I told him that I could not believe that we were going through all this because I asked him to wash his hands. He was literally arguing with me.   
I asked him about the medical board and my husband told him that it was ethical to wash his hands. He still insisted that he was not touching me. He then said ""ok is that what you want or believe in,""  ""I'll wash my hands for you,"" and he did wash his hands if that is what you call hand washing in one second.

Aside from my wait time for the chicken to be done what I disliked most was the amount of trash sitting on the tables. I notice that most Boston markets don't have trash cans displayed for whatever reason, so that's why customer just left their trash from their meals on the tabletops....I truly wish that Boston markets started being a tad bit quicker at removing trash off of the tables because if I was going to sit down to eat I wouldn't want to sit near exposed trash on tables.

I've only taken my car here for service since I purchased my car from here last year (2018 honda fit). In the winter my cars heater started to make a loud noise and vibrate the car. I took it in for that and they where able to get the vibrate to stop but the noise still happens. I was told of it starts to vibrate again I would need a new blower motor. Ok I've been dealing with the noise. Fast forward 6months I take my car for a  normal routine oil change and they didn't put a plastic motor shield on under the car correct and when I went to work it got pulled back from the wind and broke in a few places. I took the car back and all they did was use zip ties to put it in place. Its still broken its just not hanging. What they did was a temporary fix. They should of ordered a new one. I lost all respect for this dealership. I was going to buy my minivan from them this summer but I think I'm going to langhorne. I rather deal with them even though it's a longer drive. Poor service. The actual dealer was fair and decent but the service department is dragging the dealership down.,AzdXHnjfIA0ljYbyPg5roQ,1.0,2019-05-03 13:28:01,fI0HU5YEzD8V61T5bQshVw,0,2019-05-03 13:28:01

Wayne worked around an almost impossible situation:  We had just moved into our house, and the original contractor we had hired to paint the entire interior of the house 'copped out' on us midway through the job.  The house was packed to the ceiling with unopened boxes, all very heavily packed.  Wayne stepped in, and he and his team spent long hours to get the place completely painted in a timely manner, as quickly as possible, as I am allergic to all paints.  While staying at my sister's during the painting work, I developed the flu and could not return to the house after the painting was completed.  Without being asked, Wayne FED OUR CAT AND SHOVELED OUR SNOW from our walkway, not only on the days he was working at the house but even AFTER he had completed the job, knowing that I was still sick and at my sister's!  
The painting job is a work of art.
Also, we hired Wayne to do a lot of attaching fixtures to walls, and he worked on installing new plumbing fixtures and a slider door on the shower stall.
Wayne also realized that we did not have a proper gutter on the front of our house, and he did a beautiful job installing one for us.
ALL of the work he did was done in a very timely manner and was professionally done.

After examining our furnace, diagnosing the problem (faulty igniter switch), he answered all my questions with patience and kindness. He quickly replaced the part, gave it a test run, and then we had HEAT! 
Paul explained that our system was very old (which we knew) and it would be wise to start getting estimates for a new system. Based on our experience today, we will be calling Chud soon to set up an appointment for a free estimate!

I actually planned on washing my hands after I touched the door. To be honest if my husband and I hadn't had such a long tiring day I would have obviously turned around and left then. When we walked in they said they had an off menu meal,brisket. My husband got that and I wasn't very hungry so I just got a little side sample. I was expecting it to be just over 10 dollars or so. It was over 25 dollars! I was really confused. Only one of us even got a meal. Our receipt said it was 15.99 for brisket and we got extra charges because my husband got spinach for his included sides. Not sure why we got charged extra for him choosing spinach. Then my side sampler was 7 dollars. I'm not sure why they charged us this much for one meal. Every other meal on the menu averages $8 so i wasn't expecting over double that. Then when we opened the bag it was like MAYBE three slivers of brisket. I would have rather stopped at a sit down restaurant and gotten him a full meal if I knew it was going to be that much for one meal.

We made eye contact 3 times yet he failed to cease his pointless conversation and offer to take my order. I got annoyed and left. Never even a peep from the guy at the register. The manager/owner was either a racist or an ignorant buffoon who doesn't know good business practices. 

Needless to say, I'm never going back there ever again. Surprised that the hole in the wall has stayed in business for so long with such crappy customer service.

I am not surprised that others have complained about the crappy service. I wouldn't put it past him berating customers for storming out.

Unless your car isn't under warranty and they get to make a profit, then they can find things that you didn't even realize were an issue. Purchased my vehicle here less than 4 months ago, it's a ""certified vehicle."" Certified means looked over and assessed prior to sale and the cost for a certified vehicle is usually a bit higher than a used vehicle. A certified car also comes with a 12 month bumper to bumper warranty that EVERYTHING is covered on. The tire pressure light was on in my ""certified"" vehicle when I test drove it. I brought it to the attention of the salesman. When I decided to purchase the car I was told the ""brand new"" tires were a little low from sitting, they put air in my tires and the light went off. I purchased my vehicle in the end of February. The beginning of April my vehicle was due for inspection, the tire pressure light was on again and brought to their attention. I was told the problem was rectified when I picked my car up from inspection. WRONG!! Less than 1 month later in May the tire pressure light came on again, back to the dealership we go. I was told the tires were fine and that there is no leak, they reset the light and I was on my way. Well surprise less than a month later here I sit in the month of June for the same tire pressure light. Now for the kicker, a lady who works in the service department told me it's the tire pressure sensor, it's not a big deal and it doesn't affect the performance of the vehicle. That it is  $225.00 to fix it. I told her it's actually free because I'm under warranty, she told me warranty's do not cover that issue and I told her my car was just purchased less than 4 months ago. Shocked by this and the loss of profit these crooks wouldn't make she ""looked"" into my warranty and to her surprise I was right. I wonder how many people they get over on that aren't aware of their warranty's. Her mistake was telling me that there was actually an issue before she looked to see that my car was covered. They seem to be pretty famous for just resetting issues and sending people on their way when it's a warranty.

Needless to say their ""certified"" vehicles clearly are not competently certified prior to being sold. I would avoid this dealership because they are dishonest when they state their vehicles are certified. And if you get sucked into the vortex and purchase a vehicle here avoid their service department.

4879018,0,2,_CBVmULYZh5C_Limw995lw,"If you are thinking of buying a car here, RUN AWAY! I am not being hyperbolic, this is the worst business that I have ever interacted with. 

When I first went to the dealership to buy a car, I did not yet have car insurance as I had just moved from the city and did not have a car. I chose a car, left a deposit, and was told to bring proof of insurance the next day when I would pay off the balance of the car and drive off with the new (used) car. I arrived the next day at the scheduled time and had to wait more than three hours to meet with someone to finish the purchase. Staff at Sussman were in no way accommodating or apologetic. 

There was a somewhat major electrical issue less than three months after I bought the car. Again, Sussman was in no way apologetic or accommodating and I had to pay more than $1,000 after I had just bought a 'certified' pre-owned vehicle.

Fast forward to my first 'free' oil change and inspection. At this time, I was told that my car needed new air filters and break fluid, which they wanted to charge about $400 for. Over the phone, I asked that they not complete that work and that I would take it to a community mechanic. The extremely condescending mechanic told me to calm down and that none of the items he discussed would affect the inspection. When I arrive to pick up my car, I was charged for the emissions test, which is not included in the 'free' inspection.

I just left an honest community mechanic (Santillis Transmission & Auto) who told me that the air filters are basically brand new and that there is no need to change the break fluid.

This business dishonest. Seriously, run away! Do not buy a car here!",AzdXHnjfIA0ljYbyPg5roQ,1.0,2019-05-24 15:13:27,GSLS3UbNALFUt_iytbwDGg,0,2019-05-24 15:13:27

When I arrived, they showed me their system and explained how they organized the orders to minimize my confusion once I arrived home. Then they noticed I had a paper in my hand with family members' names and their selections. They explained they could've taken the names when I ordered over the phone. 

Instead of saying ""Oh well, she's on her own now"", the staff at Lee's took out the time with me to go back through the sandwiches to put names on each one. Each one! And they didn't do it in some haphazard, helter-skelter manner. They did it carefully with smiles and laughter.

All 25 orders were right that night and most of my family really enjoyed their sandwiches. They also enjoyed hearing about my experience when I shared it with them.

1.) Shannon was a big source of support since the moment she arrived at our hotel to start shooting. Because she was so involved with the wedding since the moment we booked her (engagement photos, scouting sessions, etc.) she knew exactly what we wanted, so I was able to rely on her and trust she would capture our day in the most beautiful and appropriate way. Also, she's fun to talk to and definitely not boring! You want this chick hanging out with you when you're getting ready!

2.) I am not photogenic and I can safely say that I look beautiful in Shannon's photos. She's really great at recognizing the best angles, light, and pulling everything together to create the best shot. She also provides insightful direction which was definitely helpful!  

3.) Her second shooter, Pete, is amazing. The two of them are an unbeatable team. Even though we had a small-ish wedding, we're so glad we decided to book Pete as well to capture moments we didn't think about, like cocktail hour, and all the dancing! 

4.) Both Shannon and Pete are ultimate professionals. They treated my husband and I so well, and were so friendly and kind to all our family and guests. Also - they don't hover or swarm around you like vultures for a good shot. They're respectful of your space and there when you need them! They're pretty much like magicians. 

5.) Shannon tells an amazing story with her photos. When we received the finished product (in a very timely manner, I might add), they were arranged in such a way that my husband and I were able to re-live the whole day as we scrolled through the images. We were amazed with every photo and how Shannon wove them together in a thoughtful and beautiful way.",eUnDw1oABEFGkHXAmHj43w,5.0,2013-10-30 19:08:39,mAqO_3B6H5NrquZSRkYjqw,0,2013-10-30 19:08:39

Thus is my relationship with Lee's -- five stars, indeed. 

I've been coming to Lee's for many years -- their hoagies are top-notch, and their cheesesteaks are among the best in the area, I think. In fact, even though Lee's is a small, local chain, I will often cite them as one of the plethora of cheesesteak options that are vastly superior to Pat's and Geno's. (If you're feeling daring, try the double-meat cheesestreak -- it's roughly the diameter of a redwood.) 

One of the more interesting things Lee's does is offering three different tiers of both Italian and American hoagies -- with progressively better quality meats and larger diameters. And their tuna hoagie is un-freaking-believable. A word of advice on whatever sandwich you get: get some of their hot peppers; they are the delicious crushed up, relishy kind.

Little did I know that I was about to encounter the best, fattest, and juiciest hot wings I've ever had.  I've been looking everywhere for wings that aren't like ""chicken jerky"" and Lee's has them.  Their mild sauce seems to be a mix of Frank's or Crystal hot sauce with some blue cheese mixed in with it to make it mild.  It looks kind of gross, but it was totally delish!  I was a little disappointed that they didn't have the sauce on the wings and was in a separate container.

The wings were so good, that the following pay day we ordered 50 mild wings on line and specifically put that we wanted the sauce on the wings AND extra sauce (which we paid for) on the side.  We like soupy wings!  We also paid for extra blue cheese dressing.  When we tore into our much anticipated dinner delight we were totally disappointed.  The wings had barely any sauce on them and they did NOT give us extra sauce OR blue cheese dressing.  We live in South Jersey so it would be fruitless to call and complain.  

My major beef with Lee's is that we ordered on line, gave special instructions for paying for extra mild sauce and blue cheese dressing...it even printed out on our on line receipt and yet we got stiffed out of what makes the wings even tastier to us.

Advice to Lee's...please have your employees read the on line receipt comment section for add on's and call in receipts BEFORE the customer leaves the store.

Receptionist was rude , no hello, just a curt ""did you sign in?"" Followed by are you here for ""illness or injury""?  A smile and a how can I help you would have been a much better greeting.  I was given papers to fill out and told to bring them back when I was done with identification and insurance information. 

I took my paperwork back to the desk, and asked if I could have the name of the doctor or NP that would be seeing me, I was told no, 'you will find out when you get called back"".   I was then charged a 75 dollar copay, and when I asked about the copay, this young lady rolled her eyes at me and said. ""well this is urgent care"".

I will say there was another young woman in the reception area who was very pleasant and made the required copies of my identification and insurance cards.

First time we went with the Italian Hoagie which was fresh, with an outstanding amount of meat and condiments considering it was ""half price wednesday"", they didn't take any shortcuts. Bread is fabulous (get the seeded roll yummy) soft but with the right amount of crunchiness. The fries are amazing, and they actually make them when you are there rather than have them sit for 5 minutes to get soggy, and they are made from fresh cut potatoes and not form a bag.

Second time we decided to shoot for the Angus Hamburger Hoagie, OMG heaven on bread, simply delicious and cooked to perfection. Again the quantity of meat you get is definitely worth the admission price (not like the Avocado Toting Chain sub store). Of course I have had to get me some fries to go with it.

Absolutely one of the best (if no THE best) Sandwich shop in the area.

As a transplant from NY, I like it a lot. 

A sandwich shop you'd expect from the Philly: great (and humongous) cheesesteaks, heroes are called ""hoagies"" and absolutely avoid the chicken parm at all costs. They even call it the ""chicken finger parmigian."" I like that they concede that they, like every sandwich shop in Philly, have no clue what they are doing when it comes to that sandwich. 

Last night (Sunday night, day after New Year's) and the take-out pickins in Glenside were slim. I finally thought of Lee's (which I've enjoyed a few times) and my wife and friend said ""great!""

To start, their coleslaw is a little acidic for my tastes, not great. I like that they have many bags of potato chips including kettle cooked. 

I ordered the Grilled Buffalo Chicken sandwich. I asked for the mild Buffalo sauce and was happy that it was mild. I asked for lettuce, tomato and onion and was not thrilled that none were on it. At least it tasted good and it wasn't sloppy and dripping with Buffalo sauce like sandwiches I've had at other places. 

If you're driving north on 611 to get there, a divider prevents you from making a left into it so you have to go past it, make a left off 611, turn around and then make a right back on to 611. I wish the town would get rid of that divider!

My family loved Gary and his secondary shooter (Laura Caporizzo).  They were professional and a lot of fun.

Gary has a way to be in the moment of everything yet not be in the way, if that makes sense, ha.  He was incredibly fun to work with and made standing outside in 30 degree weather totally worth it.  We got married in March and I told Gary that I would do outdoor pictures if he would.  I can tell you that at one point he was on the ground getting an amazing upward shot with the sun in the background.  It's been about a month and a half since our wedding and Gary has continued to remain in communication with us.  I'm still in awe of everything.

They always have drink and food specials. ($3 menu on Tuesday nights.) Cheesesteaks, cheese burgers, wings and chicken tenders. Not a bad deal. The food is pretty good but VERY pricey for a ""dive bar."" $11 for a sandwich that doesn't include fries? I can't complain too much because of the $2.25 Miller High Life's all day, everyday so that helps. Open mic on Mondays, $3 menu on Tuesdays, quizzo on Wednesdays, free juke box and beer pong on Thursdays and a  DJ Friday and Saturday nights. A great place to watch a Phils or Birds game with 4 big screens, a pool table and dart board. All the bartenders are very friendly especially Tracy who has been here 20 years. The Hollywood Tavern is a smoking bar so be prepared. I'm not a smoker but I deal with it and don't wear my favorite shirt when I go. Lol. Cash only with an ATM onsite and a surcharge. I guess I can say my one complain would be Bernadette the owner. Always friendly to me but very, very cheap, she micromanages the you know what out of her employees and takes up the best seat in the house during Eagles games when they play her Skins. Seriously?!

5215769,0,2,KdrXZv5HQf_B_kSKxYJteA,"When we first met Gary, he seemed really easy going and nice.  He talked about his wife and kids, his continuing education, and his techniques. We thought maybe since we had so many guests, we would need an additional photographer.  He assured us we didn't.  I really liked him.  We felt really confident that even though we were spending $2000 more than the other photographer we were considering (jpg), and the other photographer was going to bring 2 extra people, we were in good hands.  The engagement session lasted only one hour, and the positions he posed us in made us look weird.  We weren't deterred.  It was really his first time getting to know us, so maybe he didn't know our best angles.  
My parents really wanted to pick Gary over JPG because he was supposed to be good with posed shots, and they really wanted to make sure all of our family had group shots together.  She explained this to him, and he agreed, asking her to follow up with an email listing the shots she wanted.  She did.  Then she did again right before the wedding.  
I emailed Gary the room location where I would be getting ready.  Gary arrived at the hotel and texted me asking where the room was.  Since I didn't have my phone on me, I didn't respond.  When he finally found the room on his own, he started taking pictures.  My make-up was almost done at that point.  No one took any pictures of my husband getting ready.  Gary asked to take pictures of my dress.  We asked if it could wait until we got to the venue, so we didn't have to unpack the dress.  It was silk charmeuse, and we were afraid it would wrinkle.  Apparently, it couldn't wait.  He promised to be careful.  He took pictures of the dress and left it unpacked, leaving us to figure out how to pack it back up to transport it.  After arriving at the venue, and putting on my now wrinkled dress, Gary started taking pictures. He took some great pictures of me by myself.  He took some good pictures of me and my husband, and he took some mediocre pictures of me and my wedding party. We wanted all of our wedding party pictures to be outside, near a pretty waterfall and some trees, but Gary preferred indoor lighting, so they were taken indoors.  He did take pictures of me and my husband alone in the outdoor space.  After the ceremony, my husband and I went to the bridal suite, expecting Gary to take pictures of our cocktail hour.  Some of our friends complained to us that they had a great picture set up, and went looking for the photographer.  When they found him, he wasn't taking any pictures, he was collecting plates of appetizers for himself.  Apparently, he needed 3 plates of appetizers!  He was just sitting down, enjoying cocktail hour as if he was a guest.  He'd been to that wedding location before, so he knew he would be getting his own large dinner. It gets worse.  During the reception, no one could find Gary!  I wanted pictures of me and my friends!  Where was Gary??  If you can believe it, he was making out with his ""assistant"".  No one wanted to upset me during the wedding, but after the wedding, around 30 people complained about him to me and my husband.  He took around 700 pictures, though he promised us 1000. Oh, and those posed shots he promised my mother?  He never took them.  As he was trying to leave the venue, I told him I was pretty sure he didn't take the pictures my mom asked him to take, and told him to talk to her.  He claimed he never got the email.  Then my mom made him open up his email, and there they were, right in front of his face.  His response? ""Well, I never checked my email.""  Yeah, obviously.  Even if he didn't check it, she also spoke to him about it.  So, our whole reason for hiring him in the first place turned out to be for nothing.
To add insult to injury, he attempted to charge my parents an extra $1500 for the wedding album, which was supposed to be included in the contract.  My parents almost took him to small claims court, but he finally agreed to give us the album for what we had already paid.  I'm so glad I never have to deal with this guy again.  Every time I think about him, it upsets me. I'm sure 2 years ago, when he was happily married, he was a good photographer.  Maybe he doesn't think weddings are important anymore, but my wedding was important to me, and I wish there were more pictures of it.",vqJJTKD9q52DD4RcM_z52A,1.0,2016-04-28 22:17:04,NtXZ1burpAFf8tik9FYxKg,0,2016-04-28 22:17:04

(Honda, Nissan, Toyota, Mazda, etc) His prices are at a premium and his given trade in values are poor ...

The price is this price there is no give and take and if you challenge them they get downright nasty. We found the Accord we were looking for there and it was $2500 over current market price for a 2013 and our Trade in was valued at $1000 clearly $2000 below its current value. When we took a moment to attempt to question how they arrived at those figures the mood in the office got nasty. So if you are looking to overpay for a nice car, this is your place. I'm sorry I have to have at least a good experience when I'm am shopping for a car. I did not find it here.

I felt at ease the minute Gary sent a text to say that he was on his way and close by.

5275734,0,5,K91zZnBkXyb9ncuefngM8w,"If you dread the thought of heading to a car dealer and dealing with the people there, worrying about getting ripped off, etc., look no further. Nazar sells lightly (sometimes VERY lightly) used cars at a very fair price and he is a pleasure to work with. Michelle handles a lot of the business and she is also fantastic to work with. We experienced zero sales pressure. Zero!

Because they're not pushy about having you buy a car from them, they might come across as saying ""take it or leave it"". That is pretty much what they're saying, so if you want to have a back and forth with them and haggle on the price, question this or that, point out a scratch on the bumper or whatever, do not go to them to buy a car, because that's not their game. If you don't want one of their cars at the price they're selling it, they don't really care, have a nice day.

But we loved their approach because it gave us plenty of time to research the deal they were offering us in order to make sure we thought it was fair. After a couple of days of research we could not find any dealer in the area offering the car we bought at a similar price, and online price estimators came in $2-3K higher than what we paid.

Woman taking order-bad attitude like she was doing me a favor! Screwed the order up and it never got made? When we asked what was going on after 15 minutes waiting, she found our order sitting in a bag.

The sandwiches were so pathetic. Steak sandwich cold, lettuce wilted, everything was like a joke!

French fries were cold.

Anyway, I placed a delivery order for mild wings, mozzarella sticks and a 2 liter of diet soda. I received the order about an hour and 10 minutes later. The delivery person (who was very nice) forgot the soda -- ok, fine. So while I waited for him to come back with the soda I tried the mozz sticks first. EW. They were soggy, cold and didn't have any of the ""outside crunch, inside goo"" that you look for in mozzy sticks. It was like biting through a stick of cold string cheese with a sponge wrapped around it. 

So, on to the award winning wings! First of all, they were BREADED. Who breads wings? They were also cold, fatty, and the breading was spongy. When I tried to bite into one cold grease dripped out. Not pretty. And the mild sauce (which seemed like Frank's and ranch mixed together) was on the side. The actual ""wings"" were just tiny cold greasy fried chicken pieces with no sauce on them. Maybe I'm used to a different kind of wing but either way they were gross. 

So the delivery guy finally brought my soda back and...it was warm. I was so angry and disappointed. And to top it off the lousy meal cost me 17 bucks -- without tip for the driver. Maybe I shouldn't have made the mistake of getting ""wings"" from a hoagie house. Lesson learned.",nXx6nOAqC0DqVCUObuUsMA,1.0,2012-03-24 20:04:16,5K6eXnKVizn9dIdua51RVg,0,2012-03-24 20:04:16

I too like the others have experienced rude office staff & nurses & difficulty obtaining appointments, and what i really did not like was if we ever had an after hours emergency we would be connected to nurses in Cleveland using a computer program to diagnose symptoms.

 With all of that i still stayed around b/c of good experiences with the Dr's Dr. Chanioine in particular. However i suppose it is not until you have an emergency that you can really see what your Dr. is all about. My 5 year old daughter has been a patient there for the last 4 years and my 2 year old since birth. Recently I got into a car accident with both kids in the car one block away from the Abington office, and  my 5 year old was complaining of her head.  I would love to go into the whole story because it would blow your mind but it is to long. The gist of it is Dr. Chanione came out to see me, took the time to bring my kids back to an exam room and then proceeded to lecture me about office politics all the while refusing to even glance at my children. I begged him to please just look at the kids eyes and let me know there was no concussion, he refused. He could have finished an exam way quicker then the lecture yet let us leave extremely upset. Let me be clear I was not looking for special treatment, i would have been happy to wait, nor was I  looking for a free visit, i would have been happy to pay out of pocket even which i did express to them so they didn't have to bother with the insurance. All i wanted was my children's Dr to care enough about them to look at them for 2 minutes each after an accident and let me know that they were ok. 

Dr. Chanione should be ashamed of himself for the way he treated me and his two little patients, I myself was in pain from the accident and suffering from a migraine but wound up having to go and sit in an ER. for 2 hours with both kids for something that would have taken less then 5 minutes for him. I was so completely shocked at how uncaring a man who has seen my children approx 20 times over the last couple of years could have been. I don't feel Dr. Sivitz would have done this so i hate to lump him in with this group but the problem is you never know who you are going to get when accidents happen. I am so happy to be done with this nightmare of a group, Dr Chanoine should have found another profession, he and his staff  do not care about children or their parents and have no business taking care of them, they are robots who just want to shove people in and out of their office to make their maximum amount of office visits in one day.

Stephanie is patient with terrified children, but also won't baby them if she knows they are capable, which is what my child needs! 
The fitness center is good. I'd give that 4 stars. Sometimes it gets overly hot in there and I wish they'd turn up the ac, but most gyms have that issue. The staff in there are friendly, and the machines are clean. 
The classes, I'd give a 3. They don't have much variety for the times I am able to come. Early mornings are mainly cycling which I don't do. Id love a strength class early in the am. And they currently have 2 Pilates classes, which I love, but it's hard to get to. My Pilates instructor was Megan and although I'm a bigger girl who was a total beginner, she didn't make me feel out of sorts and gave general modifications so I could finish her class. I love those type of instructors!
Now, the kidzone. This is why I put 2 stars. I would put a 1. Now, it is not always that bad. The Monday morning crew know my kids name by heart and I love that. I don't even go every Monday! There are about 2 women in there that recognize my daughter in the hallway and say hello. It makes me feel good to leave her there when they are present. But when they are not present, I don't really know. 
When I went to that great Pilates class on a Wednesday evening, my friend and I dropped our daughters off at the Kidzone together. They ask where you will be every time, so they know where to find you if you are needed. Well, 45 min later, we return to her child being comforted in the corner by a staff member. Apparently, as my daughter put it, an older boy pushed her small 3 year old child, and she landed on her arm in the jungle gym area. This little girl couldn't move her arm when we got there. The staff never contacted us when it happened and my friend took her daughter to the ER. 
The poor girl ended up having to have surgery about a week later and is currently in a hard cast. The major problem I had, was that the stuff didn't contact her when it happened AND they kept saying ""she's fine"" over and over to the mother. If they were trying to cover their own ass, they should've informed the mother ASAP. 
I have no returned to the kidzone since this incident. It didn't happen to my child, but I am terrified of leaving her there. Also, there were more adults in that room that night than children. They were all crowded around each other and not spread out amongst the facility.

5358432,1,1,Dh0hWhbBWDsUPg1GOU8fXw,"Delicious... Is an understatement. Atmosphere is more then welcoming. Food quality is superb. Today 01/28/2018 was maybe my 7th Lee's hoagie house experience and each time was exactly the same... Amazing. Today for the first time I decided not to get their world famouse hoagie and went rogue, i tried their underrated simple as hell (you would think) chicken finger and french fries with a side of both buffalo sauce for the fingers and cheeze wiz for the fries, as to not ruin the integrity of the crispness. Today i experienced a life changing food oppertunity that may only happen very few times in my very long life. I will start by saying the chicken fingers by them self are well cook perfectly salted and season to perfection, but once you make the decision to dip a piece of chicken that you perdon selected to tear off with your fingers into this pink creamy sauce they have the audacity to call buffalo sauce your realize, wow what have i been doing wrong my life. If they bottled it and closed up shop tomorrow I personally will tell you Mr. Lee would still be very well off. DO NOT CUT THE CHICKEN tear that shit so you may lick you fingers after you make the greatest mistake of your life by accidently getting the sauce on them.... Now onto the french fries. First off i will tell you the size of the fry platter is absolutely proportionate to the 5 chicken fingers. That being said the fries were crispy, greesy but yet not overly greesy just the right amount to lick your fingers and say to yourself wow this some good fries. Now their cheese wiz cups... I split 1 yes thats right 1 cup of cheeze wiz with my wife whom herself had her very own experience off french fries, let me tell you the cheeze lasted between thats right 2 orders of french fries. Now im a big fan of cheeze wiz and if it were shitty cheeze wiz i would have not wasted my time at Lee's hoagie house just for that simple fact but even the detail of the delliciousness of the cheese was as if Mr Lee himself went to chemistry school and concocted the perfect cheese wiz i used plenty of it on every fry as did my wife and yet this 1 cheese cup still had enough left for my finger. So in closing after consuming the best fucking chinger finger platter (including fries and fountain which might i add is free that means no charge refills) in my life i left very full and satisifed with my food and experience. The car ride home was soo unpleasant because of the level of deliousnees that i had shoved down my gulet that i had to put my chair fully on recline. My wife could not sit up either so she laid in the back seat of my suv. At this point i wasnt sure if we made a mistake or the best decision for our wallets because all of this uncomfortable feeling of being completely full, was you guessed it..... Under $20. I cant not add that the task was still ahead, we had get out of the car and walk into our door both complaining about how we ate too much. Im a big guy 5 chicken finger and an order of fries is cake work to me. Yet the difficulty I incurred walking up the steps into my home only to collapse of pure exhuastion and over eating was well worth because I WILL BE RETURNING TO LEE'S HOAGIES HOUSE.

Let me tell you why:
Woman taking order-bad attitude like she was doing me a favor! Screwed the order up and it never got made? When we asked what was going on after 15 minutes waiting, she found our order sitting in a bag.

The sandwiches were so pathetic. Steak sandwich cold, lettuce wilted, everything was like a joke!

French fries were cold.

The place was run down and filthy!

Unfortunately the owner, who used to care(?), doesn't as no one runs the place.

This is 2 weeks in a row! I'll never go back! How do you lose a 30 year customer? 

I always say, if it's happening to me, it's happening to a lot! So sad!

So we order a chicken parm, a cheesesteak wit wiz and fried onion plus a large order of fries. Fast forward 20 minutes and we dig in. 

What a surprise that was, the food quality was abysmal. Let's start with the chicken ""parm"", chicken was dry with a hint of what is supposed to be some kind of tasteless tomato sauce. So let's move to the fries, takes me less than 10 minutes to get home and they were soggy as if they sat for about 30 minutes in the paper bag (to the point that they were stuck to it). And that is disappointment number 2. Now lets get to the piece de resistance of this pathetic excuse of a dinner, the CHEESESTEAK! OMG, dry and with no fried onion, barely enough meat to cover the bread and not enough cheese to the point it is barely noticeable. Oh and before I forget, looks the sandwiches shrunk during my hiatus from the joint.

Archaic practice intent on checking a box with bare minimum effort, rather than thoroughly reviewing child's health and treating Dad's concerns in equal proportion to Mom. Old school attitude that presumes Mom is the only caretaker and Dad's opinion doesn't count.

Missed multiple issues and warning signs that could delay my child's development, even though there were clear signs worth investigating - per Dad, another pediatrician, and a licensed professional counselor specializing in children. When pushed for a referral, they were perplexed on what he would need and/or qualify for, before finally dusting off a binder from 20 years ago and recommending a 'yoga enthusiast' specializing in adults - completely unrelated to my child's needs. The office works with conflicting nationwide data/charts (how is a height percentile curve different from one Dr. to another?), are unaware that diaper sizes stop at size 7 and thus inept at offering alternatives, and they are impossible to get a timely appointment with. And when you are so lucky to get one, they routinely make you wait for 45 minutes - with a toddler. So that's fun. This practice is a laughingstock in its own right, but made all the more glaring once you dare to venture outside of the Jenkintown bubble and see what a real Dr. looks like elsewhere.

Stay far away from Dr. Jones, especially if you happen to be a single Dad. After writing a biased and slanted report that focused on Dad taking child to another Dr (rather than addressing and assisting in child's issues), she then took 5 days (and 4 un-returned voicemails) to finally call Dad back, only to treat the primary caretaker (Dad) with disdain and condescension (presumably b/c Dad had the nerve to question the myriad findings that she failed to catch), before finally raising her voice several times, and then hanging up on me. Dr Jones stated or should I say ""yelled"" that she does favor mother's opinion and lack of concern over dad's. You can imagine my shock and sadness for my child's  treatment, not to mention me as the parent. A true professional. Oh, and I was lucky enough that this was the second time she treated me with zero patience or attention, because she claimed to have never met me even though I'd met her multiple times. Bad times all around, and (multiple) horrible experiences for both me and my child. And now another expensive call to my attorney to fight for appropriate care for my child.",-gg96o-MxRQ7s_NOyTpvJw,1.0,2019-06-27 14:57:11,WZA7DeNn7b0casTSGAcEHA,1,2019-06-27 14:57:11

Pros:
-Awesome way to spend time with family, get some exercise before that Thanksgiving Feast, and curb Thanksgiving Eve celebrations.
-Costume contest! Not that many people dressed up but the ones that did were great! Props to the turkey and the guy who ran a 5k wearing a box decorated like an oven (also this was extra motivation when he passed me- C'mon Melissa, you can't let an OVEN beat you!)
- Huge spread after the race! Bagels, bread and peanut butter, chips, juice, cake, coffee, and uh.. did I mention I undid my run in 5 minutes with three pieces of tomato pie?
-The guy announcing names at the finish line!
-Results are emailed to you or you can scan the QR code on your bib immediately after!
-Sweet long sleeved shirt and $25 registration fee! ( We formed a 6 person group and got $5 discounts.)

Cons:
-The bathroom line before the race was seriously absurd. About 75 people (ok women) in line for 2 stalls?! They need port a potties next year.
- It was fricking cold. This is not their fault, just a caveat if you want to run.
-VERY hilly!
-The sound system wasn't working great for announcements at the beginning.
- There were not that many cheerers. :(
-We thought the guy announcing names was the finish line... And then ""oh shit, why are people still running oh wait that wasn't the finish line? Ahhhh *sprint*""

5578114,0,4,gYW02PW_axvU8lrSxQvGtQ,"Took my son in today for a non-emergency condition but one that required immediate attention. I read the previous reviews which all seemed to point at a problem with the front desk but not the care.  I decided to roll the dice, throw some charm and take a shot. 

Walked in and signed in on their iPad kiosk. Immediately proceeded to the front desk with a big smile on my face. Handed over ID and insurance and got a clip board full of forms to complete. No biggie.  One receptionist was very nice while the other was, uh, not rude but a little cold.  

My wife took the forms and completed them. She happens to be a medical billing director for a regional company and caught a loop hole in the forms that allow them to charge up to $200 for ""additional services not covered by insurance"" on your provided credit card AFTER the services are completed. FLAG!!!!  By law, they have to accept the copay as outlined by the insurance companies if they accept the coverage. They can't arbitrarily add charges above and beyond based on whim. She added a note to her signature stating she would only accept charges that are medically approved by the insurance company to cover our rear. They have the right to charge for services like ultrasounds and X-rays which is fine but additional vague fees on top of the copay, no way. We also signed off that we were aware they offered on site pharmacy and we declined the service (it by passes your RX coverage on your insurance and charges you higher rates for the meds than market in the name of convenance). 

We were seen very quickly. The nurse was a bit cold but seemed more busy than impersonal. Dr Chen then came in and was fantastic.  Great personality and bedside manner. Took an uncomfortable situation for my son and made him very comfortable. She was knowledgeable and made a quick diagnoses and thorough explanation. 

Nurse returned with the discharge paperwork. Again she pushed us to buy the RX from them at 5x the copay rate at out pharmacy even though we clearly stated and signed a document stating we weren't interested in the beginning. Frustrating. 

I did get an email with a sign in on their website to review our visit info which was really good.  


Discharge paperwork was basically a form letter written by an attorney that skirted the actual diagnosis given to us by the doctor and was written to protect the company in the event the doctor made a mistake.  It totally avoided and hard commitments. Kinda disappointing and a little aggravating. 


So overall, our visit mirrored others whom posted before. Mixed experience at the front desk followed by excellent care in the back. Just be careful of hidden charge potential and their sales pitch for things like meds. For the reasons we went, we were very happy. If it wasn't that we are medical billing savy, I could see how we could have been taken for a ride.

The fresh summer rolls and the crispy spring rolls are excellent starters but the real stars in my not so humble opinion are the phos and the bun bo hue.  Whether you prefer the bone on chicken pho, or the easier to handle pho ga (boneless chicken), you really can't go wrong here.  The pho sates are also worth exploring. The beef phos are equally flavorful but for me their bun bo hue is a favorite.  Bun bo hue is the ""Hue"" style of spicy hot beef noodle soup, the broth is richly flavored and on the hotter side, but I like to crank it up to 11 for authenticity.  Normally this is the stuff of colder months but on a hot summer day, this was just the thing!  The menu also has plenty of bun (noodle), broken rice and rice offerings too.  The bun thit nuong (with grilled pork) is also excellent.

The food here is simple, honest and reasonably priced.  The waiters, two of whom used to be at Pho & Beyond, are always pleasant and helpful.  I'm tempted to let them order for me next time I'm there.

My girlfriend had been looking forward to Pho Ben City opening for a while now, and the other day she saw that they had a ""Grand Opening"" banner outside.  Thinking they were open, we and my brother went for dinner.  We parked, and there were a few men hanging around outside chatting, and one of them asked if we were there for dinner.  We said we were, and he said they were actually opening tomorrow (the banner did say the date, we had just missed it).  Without prompting, he said he'd go ask the owner if we could eat anyway.  He did, and we were told to come in.  They were obviously in the middle of a friends and family night-before-opening party, so we felt a little awkward, but they insisted it was ok. They had a limited menu, but not only was this understandable since they weren't open yet, the limited menu still included what we went for anyway, which was pho.  The person who waited us was extremely nice, and at one point a nice older woman brought us an appetizer for free, which was a fried dumpling of some sort.  We enjoyed our meal, and the food was great.  At the end, we were informed it was free, as they weren't open that night.  After our futile insisting on paying was denied, we departed.  

I returned a couple weeks later with my niece and nephew for a normal version of eating there, which was also great.  Everything I've tried was really good, and the service is great.

I found them on Groupon and wasn't sure what to expect since I've never heard of them. They're located in a small strip mall in Willow Grove, so you may miss them if you're not paying attention driving down a busy York Road. When I arrived, the waiting area smelled like lavender, so it instantly put me in a relaxing mood. I was greeted by the receptionist and she said my appointment would start in a couple minutes. After about 10 minutes, I was brought back to a single person room. It was dimly lit, but on the way to the room, I did see that they had a couple of single person rooms as well as one for couples. The massage started and I asked for medium pressure. The pressure at first was a little too hard, but after mentioning it to the masseuse, she lightened up and it was perfect!

5616233,0,3,FZkbHB5BhM7A57Q9vGUl0Q,"I wanted to treat myself to a nice manicure, but instead, I shouldn't have set foot into this nail salon.  I should have done my homework and researched this place.  Everyone's experience is different but mine seems to agree with everyone who left disappointed.  From the outside, it looks like a modern place, but once you set foot and tell them you want a manicure, i couldn't turn back.  I would have felt bad leaving and I wanted to get my nails done, thus decided to give them a chance.  They asked me to choose a color but the polishes were placed in an odd location.  Almost next/besides the counter so you're in their way and then you feel pressured if you take longer to choose a color.  THEN, all of their polishes seems like they've been through some struggles.  It's not a neat presentation of the polishes.  The material used appears old and hopefully they sanitize their equipment.  

I go to my 'nail technician' and without missing a beat, she goes for my nails with a nail filer.  At least ask what I am getting done or give me a chance to sit first.  I had to tell her what I wanted to have done.  I just hope she heard me.  Going through all the motions and I don't know, I just didn't get that nail spa feel at all.  My nails weren't equally trimmed and it just felt like a 'whatever' job.  Even better, in the background, you would hear the front guy yell loudly hello to other clients.  Nothing wrong with being friendly, but it doesn't exactly fit the mood of a nail salon.  Very ghetto.

My polish usually can last almost a week, at least 4 days, but holy moly, what a waste of money as the polish chipped the next day.  I was not pleased and would not recommend them.",71142Ice897c19VUQmVFLg,1.0,2016-07-04 05:42:10,n3GNqkgDaLCbaHmfMf85vw,0,2016-07-04 05:42:10

They were good but contained sliced chicken when we asked for vegetarian.   Our entrees were still slower to arrive and came out of the kitchen one by one. My kids were starved and I encouraged them to eat their meals. When they finished, my entree was served.

When I called for an appointment the same day (a Monday), the owner Christine accommodated me immediately. I made an appointment for 5pm that night. She was super friendly over the phone and sounded excited about me coming in. I loved that! 

Around 4 when I was headed over, she called me and said the client before me was running late and would I be able to come in at 5:30 instead? She made it clear she could still accommodate me if I could only come at 5 though. I said 5:30 was fine! 

When I arrived, I was the only one in the beautiful lobby. Christine greeted me warmly and started chatting with me like we were old friends. She took my groupon and asked me if I was pregnant (for the type of massage that would need to be done)--I'm not. She quickly led me back and introduced me to the woman who would be doing my massage. She led me to My own little private massage room with a curtain door. She explained where I could put my things and asked if hot stones were okay and if I wanted a complimentary exfoliation. I was told to strip to my underwear and lay face down under the covers. She told me to let them know if it was too warm or cold. 

There was plenty of time to get undressed and put my things away before the masseuse came in. The woman really took her time and work over every muscle. First she massaged over the blankets, then peeled them back as she needed. She stretched me out at the end as well. I could've fallen asleep and stayed right there! 

They gave me time to come back to reality and get dressed. When I came out, the masseuse had a cup of water waiting for me. Christine was kind to me until the moment I walked out the door.

My server was nice and friendly.

Now to the food.  I ordered the meatloaf platter with my choice of sides being beets and potato salad.  I thought they were kidding.  The meatloaf was 1 1/2 slice of meatloaf the size of a single fast food burger patty.  The sauce was some brown gravy that was sweet for some reason.  The potato salad had too much mayo for my liking, but that is just my opinion.

5662446,0,2,GVcLNEr9RaoQw844jGdh4A,"My husband and I are from Austin, so we really love Texas BBQ. We're not really experts in pulled pork or deep south BBQ. We were really intrigued when we found this place, which is only a minute away from where we live. We shared their 2 meat combo platter and got the baby back ribs and the sliced brisket with the carolina sauce, plus the sweet potato fries and cole slaw, which came out to a little under $15. 

The store layout is similar to a local pizza joint-- not a good place to eat in IMO (although there are tables and chairs) but great for takeout. I read an article they had hanging on their wall about the restaurant, and it said that Fletcher's was a restaurant that featured a sampling of all different types of BBQ- brisket from Texas, plus ribs and pulled pork from other parts of the south. They also have several types of sauce-- again, one Texas-inspired, another carolina, and a third that I don't remember. It's family-run by a family that decided to pursue their dreams away from corporate America. I'm always excited to try out local businesses. They said that they had been open for about 2 years.

Being from Texas, I had a few expectations of what a BBQ place should be like, but it could just be that people do BBQ differently in different places. The menu features chopped and sliced brisket, ribs, pulled pork and pulled chicken, plus a few other things like a smoked whole or half chicken. Interestingly, they don't have any sausage, which to me should be a staple. 

Their sides are also a mix of different places-- cole slaw, sweet potato fries, collard greens, tater tots, mac and cheese, and baked beans.... but no potato salad, which again is a staple down in Texas. The thing that bugged me the most was that there was no sweet tea to be found, but I'd rather take a place with no sweet tea and great BBQ than a place with bad BBQ and great sweet tea. No free side items like pickles or onions were available either.

The brisket was sliced generously, and not thinly. it's wasn't melt-in-your-mouth but it wasn't super chewy either. My favorite part was that it wasn't too charred on the outside but had nice darkness to it. The baby back ribs are fall-off-the-bone. I can see why the ribs got rave reviews from other yelpers. I wish there was more sauce on the meat, but that's probably a personal preference, as I'm used to there being extra tubs of sauce to dunk your meat in as opposed to the sauce only being poured directly onto the meat. I really liked that the meat was served on top of a delicious buttered piece of Texas toast. Delicious!

I'm so glad to find a place that does BBQ well right here in Abington and that I don't need to drive 1600 miles to get it. It's not pure Texas BBQ but both my husband and I really enjoyed our meal. We'll be back, and next time we'll try the pulled pork and some different sides!",TeVMFL7ZmZy8145Qquc2Tg,4.0,2012-05-02 00:47:40,RcrLghhOAu9IJgmr2ICR4A,0,2012-05-02 00:47:40

Maybe I've been watching one too many episodes of Kitchen Nightmares, but the minestrone soup looked terrible. It was brown and mushy. It still tasted like its usual self- strong tones of nice beef broth, but the vegetables were way overcooked and varied in size. 

Next, our main entree came out and we excitedly dug it. Took two bites before my husband and I both looked at each other and said, ""Something doesn't taste right."" It had a very slight but present aftertaste that tasted like some part of the sauce was going south, smelling slightly of garbage can. We've gotten this same exact dish probably 5 or so times in the past and it never had this weird aftertaste. We decided to send it back. Our waitress took it back and told us that they had just made the sauce today and that she could ask them to make it again, or we could order something else. We opted to order a pizza instead, which was quite tasty.

When our check came, our waitress said that she still had to charge us for the soup, even though it supposedly came with our entree. Our original dish was only $13 total, but they charged $2.95 for soup that ""came"" with it. I don't agree with that decision, and it annoys me that they would still charge us for it, especially since the soup comes out before the entree. If I would have known, I would have ordered something else that ""came"" with soup. But, what can you do. And plus, it's only $3.

5720662,0,1,eX7nSAbtWZzAJirHpLfNxg,"My work ordered from here recently and was very surprised how good it was.  We got a bunch of items and split them so the whole office could have a taste.  The meats were really good, the sides were good and the sauces were diverse.

We had baby back ribs, pulled pork and chopped brisket.  We ordered the ribs with the standard bbq sauce and the other meats dry so we could add whichever sauce we wanted.  The meats tasted good without any sauce on them which was great.  Most of the time, sauce is used to cover meats that don't have much flavor.  The ribs were perfect.  They weren't mushy and had a good flavor.  You could bite into the meat without it all falling off onto your chin.

We tried all of the sauces and none were bad.  I personally liked the Carolina sauce.  It was a good balance of sweet and tang.  While I have had better, I haven't had better in this area.

For sides, we got cole slaw (a staple), tatter tots and baked beans (another staple).  I could have eaten all of the beans myself.  They are that good.  They were cooked well and had just the right amount of sauce.  The cole slaw was good, but not exceptional.  I would definitely use it on a pulled pork sandwich without question though.  The tots were more of a novelty since they were just basic tots.  Not much to say except they taste like any other tot.  So considering that was the worse part of the meal, we were all really happy and will be going back again.  This time we will try some different sides and a different spread of meats.

The only thing that held me from giving them 5 stars is that they say they deliver, but only at night.  It would be nice to have the food delivered to my work because we would get it more.

They have TVs dedicated to sports but I don't ever feel like I'd be over-run with fanatics. I'd say the ratio of generational clientele is fairly matched, which makes it a great ""family"" restaurant.

The cheese pizza runs you around $12 for a large (or $1.75 per slice) but it's worth it. Flavors are great, cheese & crust have the perfect respected textures. The Caesar salad was fresh and plentiful, but I probably wouldn't order it again simply because I didn't care for the dressing and the chicken looked like my mom pan-browned it....but it WAS fresh and I did finish my plate. I also recommend the white clam pasta and the cheese steaks served on perfectly soft rolls. Yum!

They do serve coffee (for moms like me who somehow made it to lunch without getting a chance to get some coffee) It wasn't very strong, but it'll get you through.

They are true artists who captured our wedding moments in beautiful ways that reflect all of the unique aspects of our day. Miguel and Tracey were wonderful to work with from the moment we first met them over Skype, through the day when we received our photos. They are extremely professional artists--a rare combination! 
 
Our engagement shoot was a delight. Miguel met us in a location of our choosing, made us feel at ease, and found some really creative spots to shoot. We received the photos back so quickly that we were able to use them for our save the dates, gifts to our parents, and for our thank you cards.
 
During the planning phase, we were able to map out our photo locations, timeline, and the order for all of our formals. That planning made the day itself seamless. Although our wedding day was pretty rainy, Miguel and Tracey still found the perfect locations, moved things along quickly, and captured some incredible shots. They shot everything we wanted. Miguel has referred to them as photographer ""ninjas"" during weddings, and we really had no idea what he meant by that until the day off... They were absolutely everywhere! They found shots, angles and special moments that we either didn't know existed or thought would have gone by without record. That adorable moment between the flower girl and ring bearer? Got it. The group of college friends laughing in unison? Done. The crazy combinations of dancing friends and family? Oh yeah.

It was really packed, but I wasn't surprised because people generally go out to eat brunch on Sunday's. I ordered the Greek omelette with sausages and egg whites. It was good for the price, but nothing fantastic. 

What irked me was that it took about 30 minutes for our food to come out. We were only two people, I feel like it should've been a shorter wait time after we ordered!

I really liked our waitress, though. She was patient with us and attentive. 

I would've given this place one more star, but once I got home and the food was all settled... My stomach started making vicious noises.

Our server gave us a free sample of their chicken wings, they were crispy, juicy, sweet and savory at the same time. Some of the best wings I've had.  We also ordered the summer rolls and the deluxe pho which were great.  The summer rolls were pretty good, although they didn't contain any veggies which I was used to, however they were still delicious.  The Pho deluxe is great.  It comes with tripe unlike pho and beyond which charges $1 extra for it, and the pho itself was less expensive than over there too.

I don't know, that's always been a pet peeve of mine so probably doesn't matter to others. 

Anyways, the lady who was working on me came and did my pedicure, it was okay. I showed her a picture of a design i wanted on my nails from my phone and she looked at me like i was crazy. Mind you- the guy who works the front told me 'no problem, just tell your nail technician' when I asked about doing a design on my nails. She said she can't do it. It was nothing eccentric, in my honest opinion but if a NAIL TECHNICIAN can't do designs....then what is their edge? I told her to forget it and paint it one color. She cleaned my cuticles but i've definitely seen better, it was a half ass job. I knew she was talking in Chinese with her co-workers about me because i heard her say 'telephone' and 'design' in the same sentence and she was staring at me. I do NOT appreciate this.

I have recently been searching for a pair of shoes and found them on display here. Unfortunately, they didn't have my size. They kindly ordered them. So far, so good. 

A week or so went by and they called me to let me know they had arrived. I drove there from my house in Philadelphia to pick them up. They were not only the wrong shoes, but the person that ordered them then told me that he knew they were incorrect when they ordered them due to a stock out at the manufacturer. This was very frustrating that I was not advised BEFORE making the trip. 

I was thinking about getting a different but comparable shoe, but they were very busy and no one acknowledged existence. My business could have been salvaged of anyone even pretended to give a damn.  Instead, I was pretty much ignored then told ""tough luck"".

Guess I'll have to go to Dicks Sporting Goods for shoes, which pains me because I like to support local businesses.

Delicious ribs and chicken, a variety of sauces (I'm partial to the Carolina Style) and friendly employees.  I haven't tried alot of the sides yet but the meat is so tender and fall-off-the-bone, who needs sides?

Miquel was so easy to work with through email, and instantly I trusted his company and professionalism.  The day of the wedding, I hardly ever saw him or his assistant and I have no idea how they got the shots they did while staying so inconspicuous!  Every picture they gave me is a work of art and I'd be proud to have it on my wall, from the smallest detail, to the romantic couple shots, to the amazing party at the end.  They captured details that I never would have thought to photograph and I'm so glad they did!  They really did my perfect day justice and I cannot stress enough the need to splurge on a professional wedding photographer.

5860538,0,1,vgbWn2ULRLPk8zZX0K_e-Q,"Went here for the first time tonight for dinner, armed with a $3 off of $15 coupon. My husband and I shared the pizza fries, baked ziti with eggplant (Sicilian style), and got the cream of crab soup. 

Pizza fries ($3.50) were quite good- they're just french fries topped with tomato sauce and melted mozzarella.Very tasty if you like french fries with a little fanciness. We filled up on them quickly. We got them because we read the review on yelp advocating them and wanted to see if they lived up to the billing. They were tasty, but I ate too many of them and didn't eat much of the entree :P. My bad.

The bake ziti with eggplant ($12) was excellent. To me, what makes this dish great is the texture of the eggplant. I think it's deep fried (but not battered), which makes it very soft. It comes out, covered with cheese, on a pewter-type oblong tray and is easily splittable, especially if, like me, you pig out on the rolls, soup, and pizza fries beforehand.

My husband loves cannolis so we got one of those too. Very nice thin shell. I would have preferred the filling to have more of a nutty flavor (we love the ones from Sam's), but it was still quite good, with a simple sweet flavor. Something to beware of is that they do give you a lot of filling, but only at the ends, so if you want to eat it like a hoagie like we do, I would push the filling inward first so that the middle has some filling to go with it; otherwise the center is just hollow and filling-less, and that's just a little sad. It came in a dish with two spoons, so maybe were supposed to eat it like you would cake? But who eats their cannoli with a spoon? Pick it up with your hands, man!

 The atmosphere reminds me of a denny's. It's casual enough that you could easily bring your kids here with no problem, and the food is actually pretty tasty for those days you just need a break. Very nice relaxed family atmosphere. Our waitress was really fast, and service was great.

Mondays are all-you-can-eat mussells for $15. We saw people there with plates and plates of empty shells.

5876320,3,7,nVOh5ZPjuXEL5JD9vCAXEA,":-(  Hair in food!  :-(   We went to Bonnet Lane this morning for breakfast & were delighted to find that they now have Gluten Free waffles & pancakes.  They've also added Eggs Benedict with Crab cakes (replacing the meat), which I couldn't resist getting.  All went well until I started in on my second crab cake, which, of course, I had saved (the best) for last.  About halfway through it, I became aware of a Hair lodged between two of my front-bottom teeth.  Thankfully, I was able to retrieve it & placed it on plate next to what was left of the crabcake & about a third of the home fries.  When the server returned, I asked if they made the crab cakes there or purchased them some other place.  She said there.  I asked if they wore hairnets when doing food prep.  I think she said yes.  I showed her the hair I had found.  I was being nice & didn't make a big deal out of it.  She seemed very upset & apologetic.  However, when she returned with our check, she said, ""I couldn't take your meal off, because you had already eaten it; but I took something off.""  She TOOK A  DOLLAR  OFF!!  Here's where the logic fell apart.  No one has control over WHERE in a meal they'll find a Hair for cryin' out loud, nor WHEN during the meal they'll find it.  The point being: I STOPPED EATING WHEN I FOUND IT !!  
I understand that ""things happen"" & I'm not one to make a scene in public.  Typically, through the years, though, when a foreign object is found in our food or dining-companion's food, if memory serves, the charge for the meal is removed.  I suspect, with it being a Monday, that there was no manager nor owner present to consult with.  I watched as the waitress seemed to be discussing it with two other servers; and this was their ""solution"" to the problem.  Surely, no owner &/or manager (whose future business is dependent on how customers are treated) would have made such a decision -- at least I hope not.  I will steer clear of the place, henceforth.  If you go, just be sure to ROOT THROUGH your entire platter before you eat it, because if something objectionable is found in the latter part of your meal, it's too darn bad for you!",bSKXUH3M69T5FWPCP4qb4A,2.0,2014-09-22 20:12:05,qsYdAj9vT3tIQBKhujcqdQ,0,2014-09-22 20:12:05

This restaurant is most definitely one of them. Being a creature of habit, I always indulge myself with a solid Banh Mi sandwich and a beef brisket pho. At this particular restaurant both were spot on for the taste buds. The Banh mi had a plethora of fresh, crunchy  vegetables and savory, delectable pork; all served on a perfectly toasted hoagie roll. Shortly after the satisfactory sandwich, the pho was brought out. One thing I can't stand is pho broth with too many spices and ingredients or when the broth is too oily. Pho should be simple and delicious. My beef brisket pho was served piping hot with great portion sizes and the broth was fantastic. It had the perfect level of heartiness without being too overpowering. It contained a nice serving of beef brisket and the normal ingredients (cilantro, onions, etc.). I would recommend ordering extra onions in vinegar to add a refreshing crunch in between every few mouthfuls of pho. My only critique would be the service should be only slightly more attentive. The servers were kind and polite, but I wish they had visited my table a bit more often to refill drinks and ask how the food was.

The details:
I have driven by this spa many times and never noticed it because it is tucked away in the corner behind Blinds to Go.  I happened to stop at a traffic light at Old York Road and Moreland Road.  I turned to the left and saw the advertisement for the spa.  The location and great prices made me want to stop in for a look.   
Christine the owner took me on a tour of each room of the spa and she was very proud of her shop, workers and the products she uses (all green products).  The spa was clean and fresh and Christine made me feel so welcome that I decided to get a 1/2 hour massage on the spot.  One of the therapists took me into the prepared room.  I enjoyed a really nice massage.  When I came out to pay, Christine asked how I liked it.  I told her that it was really good but I just wished I could have had more work done on my neck.  She came from behind the counter and checked out my neck, then started to do a little work on it right there.  It was that moment that I really knew she cared about the well being of her clients.  
I have had massages by 5 different therapists there.  They all have their special talents and do great work.  When I can get an appointment with Christine, it is extra special.  She knows EXACTLY what is going on with my stiff, tired, achy neck and shoulders.  She knows what to do without me even telling her.  She applies the right amount of pressure.  I can just relax.

I had a grilled salmon special dinner for $14.99.  Must have been the very last piece.  Wasn't fresh.  And the quantity was an insult.  A tiny piece - like a miniature version about 1"" x 1"" x 4"". and 'bumped up' by a scrap that was a little smaller, and only 1/8"" high - like a small piece of lox!  I was wrong for not calling the cook over to ask what he was thinking and sending it  back.  It was truly insulting that they thought this was appropriate to serve to a patron.  I should mention the side dish too, although that was not a deal breaker. The baked potato was also tiny, which they did realize, as they served two of them.  Still, two small baked potatoes do not equal 1 regular sized one, as it is impossible to smush them up properly with the sour cream and butter when they are that tiny.

The waitress was also well off her game.  I had to get her attention after 15 minutes of doodling on my cell phone to reminder her that we were waiting on our salad.  And for dessert I ordered chocolate ice cream with whipped cream, which she repeated back.  Then she forgot the whipped cream.

Service (+): The staff are efficient. They're quick at getting your orders and quick at bringing out your food too. 

Food (+): Everything I tasted was delicious. The fish sauce chicken wings had amazing flavors, but the only problem was that the wings were so scrawny. Are these underfed chicken? These underfed chicken underfed me. The Bot Chien (fried rice cakes with eggs) was on par, just like how my mama makes it. For main entrée, I ordered the Com Tam (broken rice with BBQ pork and steamed egg meatloaf). Com Tam is one of my favorite Vietnamese dishes and this place did it pretty well. The fish sauce was a tad too sweet though, easily fixed with a squeeze of lemon to even out the flavors. 

Price/value (+/-) I think some things are fairly priced, such as the main entrees. Appetizers, though, were a tad too pricey for what they represent. For instance, the Bot Chien is not worth $8. It's literally just eggs and fried rice dough.

They couldn't understand English so I was already nervous because I have a lot of things if not told to the therapist could hurt. I was actually very cold because the sheet was left all the way down. I never ever had to stop the masseuse so many times because she was hurting and rubbing nothing that was beneficial. Then asked her to just do my legs and feet but just did my neck and back but didn't understand what I had asked and really messed up my right side, even after she brought someone in to talk and find out the other lady didn't understand either :( that waisted at least 10mins. I just honestly should have told them to stop and I wanted to leave. So the facial was just some easy basic movements and she was took a longer time putting the mask on then left the room again. Came back then said ok now you go pay and the other woman points to where a sign was posted explaining each package and what you must pay for the technician and had to pay an additional $28.00 for the service technician.

Today is the last time I go to them for any service. I had an appointment at 6 for a pink and white acrylic manicure (which is a bit time consuming) and a regular pedicure. I arrived early though because I had time to kill but luckily they took me right away. 

I never felt more rushed through a pedicure just to get to the manicure to get it over with since they close at seven. Why would you take a reservation at six when your just going to rush through what is suppose to be a relaxing luxury? 

Also, they speak in their native language which I completely am fine with. But when I hear a language I don't understand and I keep hearing ""pink and white"" in the midst of their native language in a mocking voice, while they keep looking at the clock and laughing/sighing, I now feel like a burden or butt of a joke. Again, this is suppose to be a relaxing luxury. 

Going into this business, the workers know that their job is to bring a relaxing, high-quality product to their clients. Well that is the opposite of what they gave me.

6021099,0,0,yzW-6mo9bFTBoxTCgzB95g,"Miguel and Tracey are wonderful.  We have loved them from the first moment we contacted them.  I emailed to inquire about engagement/wedding photos and asked about some specific poses/photo ideas.  Miguel very politely responded that he'll do whatever we ask him to do, but that working off a list stifles artistic creativity and forces trite shots instead of inspired shots.  Hired. Instantly.  That confidence carried over into the photos and we couldn't be more pleased. 

We're always getting compliments on our engagement/wedding photos and, in hindsight, we're glad that we don't have the same 5 pintrest poses that everyone else has.  Miguel has a special eye for light and emotion and captures it beautifully.  He is passionate about getting the right shot.  I can't count the number of times he laid down in the dirt or hopped through streams to capture just the perfect amount of light and angle.

For our engagement photos we asked if they would be willing to travel to the Atlantic City Boardwalk for us.  They not only accepted, but were authentically excited for the opportunity of shooting there.

One more thing that Diamond Street does that we haven't seen elsewhere is they're not caught up on holding onto our photos and making us beg for them.  They cheerfully gave us every photo - they even made a second copy with the photos resized for facebook.  They're a wonderful blend of laid back and service-oriented.  We never had to wait long for the photos to come back.

This was tied for the worse massage I have ever had in my life. The lady told me to keep my clothes on and did this ridiculous pricking grasp and called it a massage. She barely touched me. There was no commitment to this massage just going through the motions. 

She talked the entire time and the room was 100 degrees. She then told me to lay flat on my back. As a prenatal massage, my doctor told me NOT to lay on my back. I could barely breath laying on my back. I eventually told her I can't, I need something to prop me up. I grabbed pillows and a cover to prop my self up some.

The pasta was tasteless. The Alla Rosa sauce like water and, tasteless.  OK, gave it another chance. Chicken Parm sandwich. Aweful. Just a couple of flat pieces of cheap meat on a Amoroso's style roll and a little tasteless cheese and sauce on top. And the waitress was a complete idiot.

This was a while back, maybe late 2008-ish.

This originally was Kiku but now is Pho Ben City. The decor is very nice, it's updated, sleek, and has a very nice atmosphere. It is a pretty small place but overall it's very nice.

I already knew that this place was going to be somewhat pricey. A summer roll was 4.75, House Special Pho (Pho Dac Biet) was 10.95, and my parents got Bun Thit Ga Nuong (Rice Vermicelli with Grilled Chicken) 10.50, and a Bun Dac Biet (House Special Rice Vermicelli with Pork, Pork Meatball, Shrimp, and Spring Roll) for 11.95. The prices are understandable for the area but I love closer to places like Pho 75, Pho & More 2, Pho Quyen, Pho Viet (which are all much more reasonably priced). I would only come here if I was at work and really needed a Vietnamese fix.

The pho was very good. It wasn't the best pho in the world, but it was still tasty. (Places closer to me are much better) There was only one size and that size would probably be compared to a medium.

If you are looking for a chiropractor that is quality, look no further!--I went for years to another office in Abington, it changed owners & Dr's came & left & I finally decided there were more quality alternatives to Chiro & decided to research. This place looks incredibly professional from the door. Modern design & decor that says, we are more than just a practitioner & a room w/ a table. There are 4 incredibly talented Chiros on staff--all w/ unique approaches. In Chiro, there are many ways to adjust the same vertebra, & it's great to have different approaches from time to time. My last office, I got the same 5-6 adjustments every time--there were times I left feeling like my visit didn't help at all. Not the case here!--they have several bodywork professionals--everything from massage, accupressure & shiatsu. They even have Pilates & personal training. I love that they understand the whole body approach to Chiro, incorporating different practitioners, bodywork & they sell orthotics for your feet & supplements if need be. I forgot to mention the decompression table--a great addition to chiropractic care! They take insurance & have a very skilled insurance professional in the office. If your insurance doesn't allow Chiro--they have a no none sense flat fee. After a month of following their treatment plan, I'm feeling AH-MAZING!

Our salads were limp lettuce and some dried up carrot shavings, the dressing was good though.  I ordered the crab cake, I am always a little leery ordering seafood when out because of the possibility of it being bad.  I'm glad I hadn't read some of the other reviews before I went because I wouldn't have.  Anyway, the crab cake was good, the green beans were limp with no discernible taste.  They don't offer you any rolls or bread to go with your dinner.  To top it off I asked for an Arnold Palmer to drink (1/2 iced tea/1/2 lemonade) and I was charged for a glass of lemonade and a glass of iced tea.  Now to the service, not good at all!  Sometime after we finished our meal and our dishes sat there for about 15 minutes we started looking for our waitress in earnest.   A waitress was cleaning a table behind us and I asked her to find our waitress.  We never saw her again.  The hostesses just stood there and ignored our looks toward them.  No one and I mean NO ONE came over to check on us in 20 minutes!  When our waitress finally showed up she said she had a table in the other room.  If that's true then it is partly the hostess' fault for doing that.  We got our desserts and I asked for water.  She brought our desserts and forgot my water.  She seemed frazzled, in a 3/4 empty restaurant!

I called the studio to get some information and found the staff to be rude and impatient on the phone and in person, too.  I thought it might be due to a language barrier.  It was hard to communicate.  

The facility is nice, and much larger than I expected. They seem to have a lot of adult clients who train for competitions with private lessons. I can sort of understand why newcomers are given short shrift -- probably, teaching basics to beginners is not their idea of fun.  

There were three couples in our first group lesson.  We did not make an appointment, we just showed up with the Groupon for the 6:45 p.m. beginners class on Monday. We were taught by two instructors, a male  and female. Despite their obvious boredom, they taught us the salsa with an interesting series of pivot turns.   

One of the instructors said that with the Groupon, we get 1 private lesson.  I was trying to ask if that meant that my husband and I each get a private lesson... No.  We get a private lesson together. 

Well, we got the private (sample) lesson which was useful.  It was bookended by a sales pitch for additional private lessons which are very expensive.  In retrospect, they probably downplay the instruction in the group lessons because they want to sell the private lessons.

6177815,6,16,nq36lIsXnf_HvUzwiYws8Q,"Pho Ben City (clever ref to Franklin City), sits on Rt 611 in Abington, Pa. It is a nicely reused former fast food outpost, that is now a well designed, modern Vietnamese house with a full menu from pho to com to full plate dinners.  Service is friendly and prompt. Prices are competitive with other local pho shops, but higher than found in cities north and south by a couple of bucks.  Higher rents in the burbs lead to higher prices.

My Phone Tai was good. The broth was clear and could have simmered longer before serving to bring out the flavor. The accompanying Thai basil, sprouts, jalapeno and lime were freshly bright green. Plenty of lean beef and needles lurking beneath the calm surface. 

The roast pork Banh Mi was tasty, with nice crusty baguette holding it together. Spring Rolls were average for content and taste, while the dipping sauce was a little thin. 

Complimentary scoops of ice cream was a nice closer.

 Pho Ben City is quite good, but it does give away some of the strongest elements of Viet cuisine, perhaps due to location and clientele. I have no problem with that, but admit to liking the style used where most visitors to Saigon houses seek the full Monty of taste.

So before I start this review, I am never returning to this place ever again! I get an hour lunch, so for certain places, I call ahead and order so by the time I get there, my food is ready. This place was one of those places since sometimes you get your food on time, sometimes you don't. Last Monday, I called to order ahead and the guy said he can't do that. So I asked him if he no longer does that and he kept saying if the food is cold by the time we get there, we are gonna complain. Then I told him, if the food is cold by the time we get there, we won't complain since it was our choice to order ahead. As I was about to be like ""okay we will order when we get there"" he takes my order over the phone. When I got there, I apologized and told him I won't do it again. But regardless, we got or check so late, I was late returning to work that day. 

So today, my friend got to the restaurant at 11:50 and ordered our food. I got there at 12:11 and we were waiting for our food. We got our appetizer around 12:30 and noticed the restaurant was getting packed. Now, the 4 guys at the table behind us didn't get their water (even though they came before us) Now it's 12:45 and people behind us still didn't get their water nor the table next to us. Then the person who looks like the owner, comes to our table with 2 plate of food....our appetizer. I tell him ""we already got our appetizer (pointing at the chicken bone left on the plate) and we are waiting for our pho"" then he goes ""are you sure? are you sure?"" *FACEPALM* Like what do you mean if I am sure? So then I see people next to us who came here wayyyy after us got their soup and appetizer before us. I asked the server if he even put our order in and he goes "" I'll go check"" Like how can you not know if our food is ordered or not? 

Finally, close to 1:00 PM, we get our pho by the owner. I asked for napkins, water and a check and he was like HUH? so water and napkin? so I was like ""AND A CHECK WE HAVE TO GO"" then he comes back with water and napkin (CHECK WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND) and as he was pouring the water, I said ""thank you""  TWICE but he ignored me for whatever reason. Then finally, flagged down another person and got our check. 

I am not sure what happened to this restaurant today but that the whole hour, we didn't see our server made us think...Do they not have a cook? If they sincerely apologized for this inconvenience then I wouldn't be this upset. But all I got was ""sorry"" as they were giving me my check.

He looked at my prescription (which was for a controlled substance) with outright suspicion, and I knew right then and there I was going to have a problem with this guy. Since I'd never been to this pharmacy before, of course he had to double-check the script with my doctor's office to make sure it was legitimate. Fine. Since I was in the process of switching insurance companies and my old policy had been cancelled before my new one took effect, I was technically without coverage and when asked told him because of the situation I had to pay out of pocket. Fine. I was told to wait.

After at least twenty minutes spent browsing in another part of the (empty) pharmacy, I was called back to speak to the pissy pharmacist. Apparently, he'd checked with the insurance company whose policy I'd just canceled, but because they hadn't yet updated their records, I still showed in their system as ""active"", so he accused me of lying about not having insurance, and refused to fill the prescription. All of this was accompanied by a surly and completely disrespectful attitude; he refused to listen as I again attempted to explain the situation. Why he went to such lengths to find out the insurance company with which I had the old policy--how he got this information is a mystery, as I hadn't told him--and check with them is totally beyond me, but as said, this guy clearly didn't like me from the get-go and made no secret he was convinced I just had to be lying or was being dishonest about *something*. I'm a clean-cut guy and like to think I maintain a pleasant appearance and friendly attitude toward others. However, I was utterly taken aback by the whole situation, and told him to just return the script (I really, REALLY also wanted to tell him what he could do with it, but suppressed the urge-I just wanted to get the hell out of there) and that I'd fill it elsewhere. As I walked out I vowed NEVER to return.

I proceeded to drive to the shopping center across the street to Rite Aid where, surprisingly, the pharmacist on duty was pleasant, understood my issue about being in-between policies (I made sure that was the first thing I told her), and since I was already in Rite Aid's system, she was able to see the problem. Great! The store wasn't too busy and my medication was ready in less than 10 minutes. As I went to reach for my wallet, I realized with a sinking feeling that it wasn't in my pocket. After panicking for a moment, I realized it had to be at Abington Pharmacy, which of course meant I'd have to return, despite my recently made vow never to do so. This was my wallet, though, so obviously it was a vow that necessitated breaking. Just to be certain I had, in fact, left it there, I called and a woman-not the evil pharmacist, thank g-d-answered. I asked if anyone had seen my wallet, and if so, would they mind setting it aside while I went back to retrieve it? She refused to even check, letting me know in so many words if I wanted to see if it was there, I'd have to come back and ""look for myself."" 

WTF?!? I couldn't believe what was going on and honestly began to wonder if I was being punk'd. Anyway, I returned to the pharmacy from hell out of necessity, and my wallet was sitting on the pharmacy's counter, untouched. Evil Pharmacist must have been on a break, thankfully, because as I went to retrieve the wallet (no one even asked me what I was doing or why) I didn't see him. Armed with my wallet, I left as quickly as possible, drove back to Rite Aid, paid for the prescription, and went home. It took at least two hours to calm myself down from the entire experience. Part of me wanted to call and speak to a manager or owner regarding the treatment I received, but figured if he or she hired and kept on staff such incredibly miserable people, they wouldn't give two cents about any complaint of mine. So I did nothing. Thankfully Yelp enables me to share my horror story, warn other innocent souls about the place, and let potential patrons know to avoid coming here at all costs.",SLYdxtNbPxVlRwakPkbAEw,1.0,2012-04-02 21:29:09,8ik35d3M3KGWDuPf8BPhOw,6,2012-04-02 21:29:09

When I did go to get serviced I got a basic manicure and pedicure (Nothing to write home about). My mani pedi was okay, like I said there was nothing special about it. I feel like they charge you more money because of their location.. whatever. The thing that bothers me about this place is how unprofessional they are here! Now the two times that I was serviced here.. there was, what I'm assuming to be a female manager there she was very nice she seemed to want to try and get to know me, I actually felt welcomed! She was there the first two times that I went there. One day I got off work early, and it had been a pretty stressful day I just thought I would go and get a nice mani pedi and relax. Well when I got there, about 2pm on a Friday in my opinion it did not look like there were a lot of people in there but there was a man there that told me they were not accepting walk ins and honestly I was confused. I would have felt better if he wasn't so rude about it, but I just took it for what it was and left. This morning I just thought you know I had some errands to run and I wanted to just treat myself to a gel mani and pedi. I called this morning (since I had an issue about the whole walk in thing the last time) and when I called the man, which I assume is the owner basically said oh you don't need to schedule an appointment, just come in.. So I went in and when I got there he told me I had a little bit of a wait.. I'm thinking okay I will go and pick out my color have a seat and wait.. as I am picking out my color he looks over at me again, you're gonna have a little wait.. I say okay and proceed to look at colors.. he sits at a nail station starts to eat and he says yet again.. you're going to have a lil wait little lady, (in my mind) I'm like sir, I heard you how many times are you going to say it.. I felt like he just wanted me to leave.. So I did.. I crossed my name off the list and walked out.. you clearly don't want me to wait, so I will leave and not give you any of my money!!

We came on a Friday night and it was more than I expected. I ordered the pad Thai chicken and the seasoning was good. The chicken tastes rubbery and the beef from the basil beef. Those two had the same texture. It's not good at all but despite the chicken the pad Thai was good. The Thai tea was not bad too with soft bubble. Overall it was better than I expected but keep in mind the food around there is not good. The service took forever. They forgot my Thai tea as well. They served the check quickly without asking if I wanted something else which I wanted Thai tea. I asked two different people for boxes. One server gave me the box and the other boxed it up for me. I would come back but the food is a bit pricey $14 for pad Thai.,ETZK5PuCsVfQ7ElXckDTPw,4.0,2016-01-30 23:08:23,iVHCUezNkKRgcLwkQtFu-A,0,2016-01-30 23:08:23

However, the earliest date I can get was almost two weeks from the day I call. ( that really got me curious and wanting to check out this place more!) 

(First impression)

The place looks like a normal household.  Overall this place is very nice and clean, and quiet with a very pleasant music playing at the background. The place was decided into two areas- the waiting room and service room.  

- The waiting room has coffee, tea, filtered water and some Japanese hair magazine and Korean books. So you can get some hair style if ideas while you're waiting.

- the service room is very spacious as opposed to some place you have no choice but sitting right next to the other customers.  

(Haircut Service)

Soon as we started the service, she gave me a robe and a key for a locker to put my purse in. 
We started with shampoo and conditioner, she did a very thorough job. Then we followed up with an wet cut, which is a general layering and length job. And then she dry my hair and texturing my hair based on my hair type and haircut to make sure there is no obnoxious chunks all over . 

The lady who cut my hair is very detail oriented and patient.  She studied my hair, interpret my hair texture, and my face shape to come out with the most flattering hair cut.  While she gives her expertise, she also listen and  respect what the customer wants to make sure her customer is happy and satisfied.

The pros:
The bread was really good, the chicken and tofu were very flavorful and cooked very well, the cilantro and jalapeno were on point, the sandwich is a good size for the cost.

The cons:
A little too much mayo. And the worst part--the pickled veggies could barely be detected. I think that one of the best parts of a banh mi is the pickled carrots & daikon, but this sandwich was really lacking that. I think that it can be fixed though, maybe with thicker cut carrots (these were tiny matchsticks), so they can really soak up the flavor while they're being pickled. 

Overall, I think Banh Street really has potential. The staff was very nice and the sandwich itself was a good sandwich, but not a great banh mi, if that makes sense. With better pickled veggies and a bit less mayo, I think this could end up being an excellent banh mi.

6344346,0,1,Nxl8KTwFeeaLztfrZZ4bdw,I drove by this tiny takeout place and was intrigued with the bright orange color and had to know what it was about. While driving by I caught the name of the place and looked them up online when I got home. Everything looked so good so I went back to try it out. It was not busy when I went I walked right up to the window at about 3:30pm on a Monday and the guy at the window was nice and he made my sandwich in about 5 mins. So Ok the verdict is in this was my first time at Banh Street and it was DELICIOUS. I decided to try The Simon Le Banh and the bread was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and the bread was so warm. The carrots and slaw were pickled and the House mayo was quite tasty. The cucumber and cilantro gave it a fresh and refreshing taste and the chicken was so tender. I really enjoyed my sandwich and I will definitely be back again to try other items on the menu.,YvaccJaSqbCNOYsEqWBSCw,5.0,2018-06-11 21:21:03,5T9bT2c_jqqfmgFIEAGYWg,1,2018-06-11 21:21:03

A large menu but quality is lacking, while prices are high for what it is. Execution is very average, even the Chinese dishes are nowhere near as good as good chinese elsehwere, can't really expect them to get the other cuisines right. 

The thai stuff is very chinese reastuarant thai, the korean stuff not authentic, etc. Even a chinese dish, the chili oil cucumbers -- I'd rank them very low amongst the other renditions I've had elsewhere.

Maybe I'm just too used to all the good asian places in south philly -- we just have such lack of choices around Abington, thats the issue.

Service alright but on the amateur side, decor is pleasant.

If you expect authentic you will be disappointed.",ETZK5PuCsVfQ7ElXckDTPw,2.0,2016-08-26 01:46:23,J-JR7Jlw5cZheBxaqqbTEA,0,2016-08-26 01:46:23

The staff was attentive and nice, the food came out fast and fresh, and the bubble tea drink was good with just the right amount of sweetness.  The decor is comfortable and very red, red everywhere, they sure like red... :)

I ordered the kimchi fried rice with chicken and it was a bit too bland for me.  I wish there was a bit more taste.  It had the red pepper sign for 'hot', but it was not spicy at all.  I kept having to add sriracha.  Maybe it was just my dish that was bland, my family seemed to have enjoyed their dish, so that's more important.  Everything was fresh, so no complaints about that.  It was a healthy portion so I was able to take what I couldn't finish to go.

Now, why did I only rate it only three stars??!!........... 

At first glance of the menu, the prices were inflated from what I saw online.  Then a closer look, it appears the prices are different AKA higher on Sunday and there is no lunch special??  I think this alone put a sour taste in my mouth.  $3-4 difference adds up really fast, so if I decide to go back, I will make sure to go on a Saturday when they still have the lunch priced specials.  Kinda deceiving cause once you're in the restaurant, it would look odd to walk out, so you're sorta stuck paying the extra few bucks.  Perhaps the higher prices on Sunday is due to slower traffic, but it just doesn't seem right.  

The next thing that sorta made me go 'ughhh' was the little 'open and exposed' container on the tables.  It was filled with black liquid, so I am thinking it's soy sauce.  Yes, I said it right, it was an open container, so what if I happened to sneeze or drop something in there by accident, then it's contaminated.  Maybe I am being nit picky, but it doesn't seem very 'clean'.  There should be a cover or put in a clear container so your customers can know what is in there.  I sorta cringed when the staff was cleaning the table with a blue spray, they had to move the condiments to another table before she sprayed the table to clean.  Then there is also a little cute bottle with red stuff in there.  Maybe it is obvious to some people, but at first I thought it was ketchup, but in fact, it was hot sauce.  I know it probably doesn't make sense for it to be ketchup, but the style of the bottle is like a ketchup bottle.    

Final verdict, Will i go back?  Yes, but not on a Sunday.......",ETZK5PuCsVfQ7ElXckDTPw,3.0,2016-04-26 02:26:29,n3GNqkgDaLCbaHmfMf85vw,0,2016-04-26 02:26:29

1.  Poor ratio of bread to fillings.  Huge loaf to a skimpy portion of meat and veggies is disappointing.  Too many bites of mostly bread.  Ends of the loaf were discarded because they had nothing in them.

2.  Iced Vietnamese coffee needs to be strong so the condensed milk soothes the bitterness.  Putting condensed milk in watery coffee is not so tasty.  ~$4 is too high for this drink too.  Condensed milk doesn't mix well in cold liquids.

3.  I felt like I paid too much.

The ingredients were good.  Bread is toasted and crusty.  Lamb meatballs, while a little cumin-heavy, were cooked well and had a good flavor.  Veggies were a little limp and thinly cut (flavorful).  Not enough hot pepper or cilantro.

I just wish the bread was smaller or there were more contents to the roll so that every bite was a good mix of bread and fillings.  Flavors are good and some sriracha/hoisin sauce on the sides would be great addition.

A wife (front of the house) - husband (back of the house) team operate the place. She is Chinese... he is Polish (sounds like the basis for their next restaurant!) The menu offers a variety of pan-Asian dishes most heavily leaning towards Chinese, Japanese and Thai (some marked as spicy). The decor is bright, clean and modern (yet feels slightly 1950 retro in a good way). We were the only patrons for the first half of our meal (Tuesday night, 7:45 PM). We ordered a tasty wonton soup (the wontons were pork and shrimp and beautifully made); Pork belly buns (excellent and bursting with many flavor-notes); Pineapple chicken fried rice (excellent); an excellent Mango Smoothie; Tonkotsu-style Ramen soup (excellent broth cooked 20+ hours, very good noodles, mushrooms, marinated egg and pork slices... but the broth needed to be much hotter and because it wasn't... the egg and pork slices (both refrigerated until being added before serving) were cool to cold. I kind of heated them by submerging them in the soup... but overall the broth needed to be hot. An easy fix. The only negative (and it's just inexperience) was the server... a really nice and friendly 18-year-old college kid. I asked him how a certain dish was prepared (seeking and expecting a description of the dish). He said, ""The Chef cooks it in the kitchen right before it's served."" I had a big smile when I heard that. It was cute but clueless. I asked him to please tell me about the ingredients. He looked at the menu and read what was listed. He also didn't clear anything prior to bringing the check. BUT... he was kind and friendly and checked back to see if we were happy. I just felt that if the restaurant was packed or even busier... the newness of the routine there would have presented problems. He's a smart fellow and personable. He just needs some training.

The bao buns are pretty good as far as I've noticed. The wings are hit and miss. This time, the sauce coating it tasted like it was at the bottom of the barrel so it was thick and salty. 

The fried rice is also hit or miss, sometimes it taste good, sometime it doesn't. I tried the kimchi and the crab ones and it wasn't very memorable.

The curry is a hard pass. It's very watered down compared to other places that sells curry. The ingredients weren't cooked inside the sauce, instead it was boiled in water and placed into a bowl and the watered down curry sauce was poured over top. This resulted in tasteless veggies. 

Service is also hit or miss depending on who is serving you. In the beginning it was a white male, then a black female, and now an Asian one.

As I watched a waitress clear our table I saw she left plates from the previous seating..ok they were unused but how did they know they weren't touched or coughed on..just gross and lazy to not just replace them. Ok no biggie..push plates aside. 20 minutes later water was brought over, 15 minutes later they took our order, an hour later we watched the same waitress take our meals to another table. One person started eatting but the other person after a few minutes mentioned it wasn't their order...so what did the waitress do...picked up the one plate and brought it to our table. Again, how did she know it wasnt touched and now only half the order is being brought out so I asked for our order to be remade which she didn't understand or appreciate. 2 hours after entering the restaurant we left with our dinner in takeout boxes. Empty tables were left filled with dirty plates, water refills were not cleared, and no one stopped by to offer apology for wait or if we needed anything. At checkout, I spoke to the owner and the excuse was the kitchen was overwhelmed. No your waitresses need training.

6436976,1,11,gMD9WYPRUx0dq1r1PXO_3Q,"I want to try and give this place the benefit of the doubt since this is the first day they open and am willing to give them another try in about a month or two and possibly revise this review.  As a sandwich I would say it's okay as a banh mi I think it fails.  I will say that the bread is really good and the protein was cooked very well.  It's the other things inside that made it missing what makes it a banh mi.  

First off all their sandwiches are $9.25 which is pretty expensive for a banh mi.  Most places in philly are under $5.  Even the two Vietnamese places in Willow Grove are around that price.  I expected that if I pay that much that it would be a foot long sandwich or filled to the rim with food but it was almost the opposite.   It didn't have enough of everything else.  The carrots/daikons weren't sweet and tangy and also didn't have that crunch.  I barely tasted the jalapeno.  The flavor that was most prominent was the maggi seasoning.  It may have been overwhelming because of everything else that was lacking.  My wife said it best when she said it's not banh mi'ey enough.  


Going to each individual protein the shrimp was cooked very well and I tasted some of the lemongrass but not so much ginger.  The hot dog tasted like a hot dog.  Even if Thomas Keller made a kobe beef hot dog I'm not sure if I can tell the difference so I won't fault them for that but making it kobe seems like a way to either overcharge or make it sound better than it actually is.  The meatball was salty and it wasn't the flavors I expected from something I thought would be like ""thit nuong"".   The chicken breast wasn't dry and had the charbroil flavor so that was actually pretty good.  I didn't try the tofu or the grilled vegetables but all the sandwiches are the same price so I can't justify paying the same price for veggie version.  


Again I am willing to give this another try in a couple of months to see if they improve.  Right now they seem to be a work in progress.",YvaccJaSqbCNOYsEqWBSCw,2.0,2015-12-02 00:41:31,J8MnQ4yhmSrMnPBW4m2A2w,1,2015-12-02 00:41:31

We've ordered both the shrimp and chicken varieties on two occasions and she mentioned that both times.

I wouldn't suggest that eating there, as there is only outside seating on this tiny patio, basically overlooking busy Easton Rd. However, these banh mi are best eaten hot (or warm anyway). Best plan is to call ahead and order, then pick up just when it's ready and get back home as soon as possible. My little trick this winter is to turn on the seat heater on the passenger seat of my car on the way over there so I can keep the banh mi hot on my way home.",YvaccJaSqbCNOYsEqWBSCw,4.0,2017-02-24 19:46:58,SNfdtNKgPf7seqxF2NKwNw,0,2017-02-24 19:46:58

Normally I am afraid to get my hair cut because some dressers just like to cut a lot of hair right off and try to style it. BUT, when I came to Arte I told her I do not want to make my hair short and she accommodated my desire. I totally support small family own businesses because they take care of you. Just make sure you make an appointment ahead of time.

PROS:

1.) The Staff are  EXTREMELY friendly, generous, funny, and social.

2.) When your hair is being washed, they DO NOT pull your hair like other places do, they gently wash your hair and do it in a way in which it is so nice and relaxing.

3.) The furniture is beautiful and the decor is nice and clean.

4.) Ladies if you are like me and love to put on your makeup almost everyday, DO NOT be afraid because they put a shield on your forehead to prevent any  water, soap or hair on your face (So your makeup looks totally fine).

5.) The hair dresser is honest about what may look good on you and how to better the hairstyle you pick by adding TEXTURE.

6.) The hair dresser also told me, "" I have to be humble and caring to your hair."" And she took care of my hair as if it was her own hair.

7.) The hair dresser also does males and females. Males will love the results after their hair cuts too.

8.) She cuts fast, I do not like being in a chair for such a long time but when the hair dresser gets her scissors she is focused and does the job right.

9.) When she blow drys your hair, she will style it to make you look fabulous when you leave the salon.

Turns out they billed the wrong local insurance for me so I was not able you get a refund until this was fixed. I am still waiting on my refund. There is only one person working in the billing department so it takes atleast a week for her to return any calls. This is dragging the process out even longer. I still don't understand why they collected co-pays when I told them it was not money we owed since our OPP max was reached  (verified by my insurance). So I was seen back in September,  its now March and I am still waiting. My only complaint with this place is billing and how they are handling/handled this situation.  Otherwise I loved the treatment there... truely compassionate.
My advise... know your benefits and if need be, get something in writing from your insurance so you don't have to go through this hassle.

Former review:
I wasn't a patient very long here bc my insurance changed so I had to leave. Of the 3 fertility clinics I've been to, this one was the one I felt most comfortable at. The doctor took an hour at our consultation to fully explain everything to me where other places were brief and took maybe 20 min.  I usually felt rushed at other places. I felt like a person here and felt like the doctors and staff were compassionate enough to care about me and what I am going through. I also learned so much in my visit.  I was so sad to leave.
I can say I am not too happy with Billing either here. They actually owe me money. I tried explaining to them I reached our out of pocket max for the year with my insurance and they still wanted to collect money each visit. I verified this with my insurance company and they also told me I should not be paying co-pays. I even rcvd a bill so I will be calling them to get my co-pays back because it was money never owed to them to begin with. Given some of the other billing issues,  I'm afraid I will have difficulty getting my money back.

I called the delivery driver who had just called me from his phone, but he didn't answer. I called the restaurant and spoke to the female employee that answered the phone. She said they forgot the soup and said they'd refund. I said I'd like the soup and then inquired about any soy sauces that would have been sent along with the order. She informed me that I had to ask for them at the time of the order. I explained that I had never heard of such a thing as every Asian delivery I've ever gotten came automatically with sauces. I said that I thought that was ridiculous. I then asked if I could have the soup sent and was abruptly hung up on. I called back several times, and they did not answer my calls (I suspect they have caller ID). My wife called, and they did not answer (her phone number is similar to mine and at first they were picking up and hanging right up). She blocked her number and eventually got through.

Angel again said that it wasn't the driver, and my wife suggested that they tip him. Angel said ok but it wasn't the driver's fault (although Maryann told us earlier that the driver forgot it). The customer service, or lack there of, is rather appalling when you consider how easily this could have been resolved.

To me, being comfortable and trusting your Heath care providers is half the battle (obviously they have to be knowledgable too). Dr. Barmat is super nice, caring, and he actually listens.

He just seems like an old friend who just so happens to be your doctor. A cool guy, a nice person, and a good doctor.

Today he operated on me to remove a cyst from my ovary and some endometriosis. Again, when I saw him both before and after surgery, he was funny, kind, and caring. It really helped put me at ease.

The whole process was easy as pie for which I was extremely grateful being that there are enough things in life that require a tad bit more attention. So it was my day off, I was exhausted, and just was hoping for an easy going day. The whole process with target studio was a breeze. I easily booked the appointment and when I arrived I did not have to wait. The photographer called us back immediately and we began choosing backgrounds as she started offering different ideas. Her name was Jasmine and she was sooooo patient with my 2 year old and my 8year old. She made funny faces to try to ease up my frightened daughter who kept screaming for me. My daughter is very attached to me, yet jasmine was able to get her comfortable enough to go take her pictures and smile in every one, which by the way came out gorgeous. What really sold me on jasmine and target is the fact that she never rushed me. The studio closes at 4 on Sunday and I'm a very picky parent so it takes me quite a while to pick and choose, yet she never made a face nor a sigh. I kept apologizing and she assured me that she doesn't mind being there, her most important goal was to make sure I love the pictures that I'm getting. We didnt leave until 7pm, 3 hours after her shift ended and she still not just smiled but participated in offering me cute ideas as I customized every single photo. Also, my daughter made a mess and she helped me clean up. She was a great warm,welcoming, loving, yet professional personality. I recommend her to absolutely everybody!

I went with their recommendation for the pork meatballs which I honestly would have never chosen, but they were insistent it was the best by far. They have a dollar up charge for a special sauce on the bread which seemed a little odd to me as well as the $8 cost which I am used to being more than half of that for my usual Banh Mi favorites. Explaining the bread is bigger I gave him the go ahead and after a few minutes I was ready to get to business. The sandwich was good, but not the authentic version I was hoping for.

I've never had a Vietnamese hoagie before and wasn't sure what to expect but considering it was Chad's inspiration running the operation I had high expectations. Especially from a guy who specializes in barbecue meat (what's a vegetarian to do?). 

I chose laundry day as the day I'd go to Banh Street. It's set up in a brightly colored orange shack. It's sticks out on the main road amongst mid century buildings like a tropical retreat. You can't miss it! There's even a tiny parking lot to the left to match. To the right are patio tables with umbrellas. It happened to be a lovely day for dining outside. Whatever you do, DO NOT attempt to open the front door; the order window is on the patio side (yup, I tried to open the door). Lots of meat options on the menu and BONUS: TOFU! I'm in heaven at this moment as it only took my five seconds to decide my order. Ordered and paid at the window and waited about five to ten minutes. As I sat down with my hoagie I could already smell the flavors wrapped inside. The hoagie is about a foot long. The bread is specially made for this place. Super soft and perfectly crispy on the outside. The filling was so colorful with daikon, cilantro and perfectly grilled tofu. Whatever the marinade is for the tofu, it's perfect! Cooked to the perfect firmness that most places can't achieve. The overall blend of flavors were perfectly balanced in every single bite. My mouth was doing its happy dance! Before I knew it, I had consumed the whole thing without having taken a picture to have as one of my favorite first time food memories.

I had never experienced a Vietnamese hoagie before so I didn't know what to expect.  My review is not on how authentic this Banh Mi is but how it compares to other sandwiches in the area.  I decided on the The Craig Lebánh with a fresh squeezed lime soda.  The Lebanh has grilled pork meatballs with house mayo, pickled daikon, carrots, cucumber, cilantro and jalapenos.  A good sandwich must be surrounded by a well made roll and this sandwich doesn't disappoint.  It was one of the best rolls I have had in some time.  The meatballs were awesome and the house made mayo reminded me of a more flavorful tzatziki sauce.   Lime soda was also a first for me and it was like a carbonated lemonade that was both sweet and tart.  I don't remember the exact cost but my total was around $11.  I thought the price point was in line with other sandwich / drink combos.  All of the ingredients were fresh and everything but the roll is made in house.

I read the other review of Banh Street and the price was questioned. If you compare this sandwich to any other in there area in which all of the ingredients are fresh and made in house you'll agree that the price is very fair.

Came back here for lunch around 4:30pm again. This time, the service was soooooo slow. After we were given our menus, we waited a good 15-20 minutes for someone to take our order and 45-60 minutes for one entree and an appetizer to come out.

Danielle, the girl that took the pictures, was very nice and very good with my daughter. She took the pictures and was very patient while my mother and I picked which pose we wanted in which size. It was overwhelming so that took a while. We opted to have them delivered directly to us and payed the extra for that because we needed them by the 10th which was my daughters 1st birthday party and she assured me that I'd have them well before that. She even told me that they do deliver the pictures on Sunday which I thought was odd but she insisted on this. I later found out that wasn't true. She told me that I'd have the pictures in 7-10 days. The pictures were taken on Saturday September 26th. She told me that I should get them the following Saturday and that if I didn't have them by the Monday after that to call them. I asked her if she was sure and asked her if it was 7-10 business days or just 7-10 days. She assured me it was just 7-10 days. I waited till Wednesday to call because I didn't receive them. Danielle called the company developing the pictures and they told her that I should have them by no later then the next day. Danielle told me that if I didn't receive them the next day to call them back. 
The next day comes and no pictures so I call again and speak to another girl. Her name escapes my memory. I had left a message and she called me back within an hour or two. She had called the place where they develop the pictures and they told her that they probably got lost and that they'd send another order out but they wouldn't arrive until Monday the 12th. I told her that that was unacceptable and that I was assured that I would have them when I needed them which was the 10th. Her attitude was pretty much like ""oh well."" She even had the audacity to tell me that she'd send some pics in a email and I can go have them printed else where. So basically she wanted me to pay again for an order I already payed $200 for!!! Can you believe that? 
Someone must of answered my prayers because the first order came on Saturday when everyone was about to leave the party. That's way later than the 7-10 days it was promised and still late even if you go by 7-10 business days. I also did get the second order on Monday so I got 2 orders.

The shop itself is a cute little addition to the side of the street and they've really maximized their space, offering a few parking spaces to the left, and patio-like seating on the right (check out the pictures attached). 

As soon as I walked up to the patio with the intention of looking at the menu, the owner Leon emerged from the inside of the shop to ask if I needed some help. He proceeded to help me choose my bánh mi by helping me figure out what I was in the mood for. 

I ended up ordering ""The Bánhie & Clyde"" which is flavorful, marinated shrimp, house mayo (which has a nice garlic taste), pickled daikon and carrots, fresh cucumber, cilantro, and jalapeño on a delicious baguette. 

While I was taking some pictures to add to my Yelp! review, I was talking with Leon and Kris (who works the grill and makes the sandwiches) about the business and how they got into it. Turns out that Leon is actually Native American, and Kris' parents met in Vietnam (he's Vietnamese-American with the prettiest clear blue eyes).

Yelp helped! I kept searching for someplace in the region, with high marks for color and cut. ARTE Salon kept coming out on top. 

I went yesterday for the first time, and now I'm one of those positive Yelp reviews. Everything everyone wrote is true. The stylists (mom and daughter) are welcoming, warm, and pampering. The salon is spotless. Seems spa-like. Before starting, the stylist took a long time looking at my hair quality and color.  Just as important, she listened to me. 

But most of all, my hair was literally transformed from a dull dark blond brittle mass into a vibrant head of hair. It's shiny and silky. 

I think it's a combination of the talented stylist and the lovely all-natural Japanese products they use. I'm sold.

I don't expect much from a fast food restaurant, but this is one to avoid. 
First, counters at the register were noticeably dirty. It looks like they could care less about the counter. 
Then I started to notice other dirt and poorly cleaned locations. The drink dispenser area for example is not kept well. Then I noticed someone cleaning, he had a rag and was wiping down. Then he rearranged the lids. Wait, did I just see that. He took his wet dirty hand on the lids people place on their cups? 
Walls have soil marks as well. 
Second, it is March so I ordered the Shamrock shake. I've liked it before. Not this time, whoever prepared it has the formula wrong. Way too much mint and it ended up tasting more like toothpaste. It became drinkable after rigorous mixing and insuring all the whipped cream was mixed in. And it was not just mine, another person ordered one and it was the same. 
The fries tasted like they used stale frying oil. It is not a taste I like.

photographer was very professional,patient and friendly especially with my 7month old son.

And we ordered tonkotsu ramen and szenche(?) chicken (pretty weird difficult name) and taro bubbles tea and iced thai tea. Later, employee came to apologize that they are out of ingredients for takoyaki. Which was frustrating. We were gonna change our appetizer but nothing seems appealing to us. So we ended up eliminating appetizer from our order. Food was just average. Nothing impressive. For almost two hours(?) (it felt like forever) none of employee came to our table not even once to refill water or to ask if we need anything. And then couple more tables came in. We grabbed one employee and asked for check. We went to the front desk to pay with groupon and pay off the balance. Total came out 32.60 something.

It was hard to understand this person is an understatement along with the insanely loud noise in the background it was a bit irritating.

And too boot I only received about 3 pieces of shrimp and a wedge of lime that was dehydrated and dry.  I was infuriated and still starving so I tried to choke down as much as I could because at this point I had spent my last 20.00 and it was after 10pm(ordered around 745pm) ok I'll give it to them the Chinese donuts were nice(that of which basivally became my dinner) I didnt bother calling to complain after the first experience of contacting them...but now I know why the bad reviews trumped the good ones on grubhub.

The Taro Bubble Tea is powder and tastes like water basically. The bubbles where not good. I expected this, but gave it a chance anyways. I really shouldn't have. I will wait patiently for Kung Fu Tea to open up a few blocks away before I get bubble tea from around here. 

For appetizers my friend and I ordered a Pork Bao Bun, Karaage Chicken, and Pork Dumpings in Hot Chili Oil. Honestly, opening the bun box I should have known that would be indicative of what the rest of the food would be like. The slice of pork belly wasn't thick and did not take up even half of the bun space. There was a drop of sauce and a very dry looking slice of cucumber in each bun. In taking a bit the buns and pork were cold and the bun tag wasn't full cooked. The flavor was under whelming. Karaage chicken was more reminencent of Taiwanese Popcorn chicken without the traditional Taiwanese popcorn chicken flavor. The sauce that can with it tasted more like a cheap end off-brand Sirracha imitation. The Pork Dumplings are full of meat, but the sauce was definitely the typical hot chili oil sauce that usually comes with such a dish. No spice at all, usually there is a little kick to these sauces, and complete too sweet.

For main courses we ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen and Szechuan Popcorn Chicken. The broth in the ramen has some flavor at least. The pork was mostly fat and the actual pieces of meat that you could get off of the fat tasted oddly sweet. The seasoned egg was straight up super salty. I need to dig of water after every bit of it. The Szechuan Popcorn Chicken was also oddly sweet. It wasn't at all spicy. Not to mention it was saturated in oil. I could have take this thrown it in a pan and oiled the pan with it to cook something else. 

I should have saw the warning signs since this place does Chinese, Japanese, and Thai food. Places like these are usually a no go. Anyone who says this food is amazing clearly hasn't had much authentic Asian cuisine or only ever tried Chinese-American takeout. Or maybe I'm just spoiled by Asian food from Chinatown, Philadelphia, Chinatown New York, and Flushing, New York and expect food from the suburbs to taste the same as restaurants in those locations.

I don't think this is the place to come for that. Ordered the drunken noodles, my favorite dish for Thai. I asked for medium spicy as Thai food is supposed to be pretty spicy but what I got was bland. The flavor mostly came through as oil. If you like drunken noodles and know what it's supposed to taste like, don't order it from here.

Giving it 3 stars because the other dish we ordered Chinese eggplant with shrimp was really good. The sauce was flavorful, but definitely not spicy. I'm assuming the dish isn't supposed to be spicy which makes sense because it has a lot of other flavors going on. Bottom line if you like moderately spicy food make sure to say spicy as medium is interpreted as mild. 

The interior of this place is nice and modern. Reminds me of a panera bread for Asian food, casual place.

Ordered Chicken Pad Thai 
Korean Ribs 
Ban ban shrimp 
Alaskan roll
It could be the fact that they serve all sorts of Asian dishes here, everything from sushi to Thai to Chinese. 
The sushi didn't taste very fresh and it was just packed with huge slices of cucumbers, making the texture hard and Unenjoyable.
The ban ban shrimp had a description of: basil sauced with grain crumbs... but the fish had no sauce, just dry deep fried shrimp. We had to ask for some Thai chilli sauce for flavor. The shell were also still on the fried shrimp, making the shrimps extremely difficult to eat. 

Should have really stopped ordering food at this point, but we waiting on our Pad Thai. If you're looking for Pad Thai to crave your taste buds... you'll be extremely disappointed. 

The service was extremely slow. It could've been because there were only two servers. Our waters never got refilled until we were ready to leave, while all the dishes that we ordered were so salty or dry, it would've been better if we had some water.

6662635,1,8,jDWfU1PUj-GrH8LeNeoiXQ,"Ban Ban styles itself as an Asian fusion bistro and I guess that's really what it wants to be.  What it is not however is authentic Asian fare.  In my experience Asian fusion means one of several things like, 1) I'm a non-Asian chef but my friends tell me I have a flair for ""Asian""; 2) I'm a non-Asian chef and my significant other is Asian and she/he likes my cooking; 3) I'm a non-Asian chef and I've visited Japan, Korea, Thailand, etc.; or 4) all of the above.  This is not fusion cuisine but rather a con-fusion of tastes which unfortunately stopped short of delivering.  In my opinion, unless you're a real David Chang type talent, these are not waters that your average restaurateur should venture into.

Case in point, like the other reviewer, I happened to stop in for lunch the other day as well.  I ordered the Korean chicken wings and the aforementioned Dan Dan noodles.  The Korean wings simply lacked the heat and spiciness of other Korean wings in the area (e.g. Soho cafe on Chelten Ave in nearby Koreatown) and were served with a sticky sweet sesame seed flecked sauce that managed to overpowered any spice that the wings might have had.  It reminded me of a doctored store bought BBQ sauce.  The homemade kim chee that accompanied the dish was sadly bland.  Store bought (H-Mart is just down the block) would have been far better.

The Dan Dan noodles were anything but real Dan Dan noodles in my experience.  Trust me on this one, I ate Dan Dan noodles all over China.  Instead of a deeply rich brown, sichuan peppercorn and chili pepper infused ground pork sauce on thin noodles topped with the ""de riguer"" blanched baby bok choy, the Ban Ban version of this dish was essentially a mixture of tahini sesame paste, some ground peanuts and separately cooked minced pork over pretty thick noodles. Nary a slice of chopped scallion or a hint of bok choy to be seen.  It was sort of a thick gloppy mess requiring both hot sauce and soy sauce to tone down the sesame paste / peanut mixture and balance the flavors.  Think of the cold Chinese noodle with sesame sauce appetizer but warm and with some ground pork and that's the dish.

Perhaps it's not fair to judge a restaurant on such a limited tasting menu but in my opinion if you're expecting real Asian fare, you'll not likely find it at Ban Ban.  On the other hand, if a mish mash of different, ""sort of Asian like"" tasting plates is what you're looking for, have at it.",ETZK5PuCsVfQ7ElXckDTPw,1.0,2016-01-15 22:30:01,hAYaKIaDbAmTN6K8U0b_dg,3,2016-01-15 22:30:01

He told us where they get their bread from and what sets their banh mi apart from others.

Food: Great
After hearing all of these awesome descriptions, I was worried we might be let down when we received the actual food.  The sandwiches, however, definitely lived up to expectation!

Ribeye Special (was not listed on the menu) - really good.  This was my boyfriend's sandwich and he got it the way it is offered, which included (homemade) mayonnaise.  Usually I don't like mayo but it was such a light swipe here and mingled with the beef in just the right way so I didn't even mind that it was there.

The Banhie & Clyde - Shrimp is the protein on this one, and it's so good!  Really fresh tasting.  Would definitely recommend. (Got it without the mayo; no problem to get it on the side)

Vietnamese iced coffee - Delicious.  Strong but balanced - it wasn't overly sweet or overly bitter.  They hand drip this so just like everything else it's made to order.

A friend of mine recommended this restaurant to me. she looked up yelp and it had high reviews and she really hyped it up so I had high expectations. 

When I arrived at the restaurant I thought it looked very clean and spacious. The decorations were very nice however the chairs and sofa were very uncomfortable, they were hard and felt awkward. The server was very nice but I guess he was new. I sat there for almost 20 minutes and he never offered me a drink of water.

As for the food I ordered takoyaki, Japanese squid ball. This dish is known for its fluffy batter (think funnel cake but more airy) however, at Ban Ban they were deep fried! (Think hard tater tots). I also had drunken noodle and Korean spare ribs. Both were very dry, the ribs themselves were not salty enough, just a hint of sweetness and way over cooked.

We also ordered their signature ban ban shrimps. It is served as an entree but really should have been an appetizer. The shrimps were basically deep-fried with a lot of coconut shavings on top. No sauces accompanied the dish, it's very dry. 

The ramen noodles were not so bad but they are also not very spectacular. Definitely not something that you will want to come all the way here for.

    The Docs are amazing! For anyone just starting the fertility process it is daunting, and emotional and expensive and you are vulnerable to say the least. Dr. Somkuti is just the best!  He is caring and kind and makes you feel totally at ease (and as an MD & PHD, needless to say you are in the best hands).  Dr. Sobel I saw a few times due to appt timing and had to drive out to the mainline and if I lived out there I would be in heaven to see him...such a great bedside manner and makes you feel that you can accomplish anything.  Dr. Lee doesn't give you the warm and fuzzy as much as these gents BUT she is exacting and did my successful implantation so who cares...as a cancer survivor as well and seeing so many doctors with that and this all I can say is if I have to choose between a doc who is exacting and the top of their game or one who makes me feel good and gives me a hug, I will always go for the former.  So with any of these docs you get the top of the field (Somkuti did a friend's implantation and she has a beautiful little girl). We have our family and friends for the hugs!  So now I am a cancer survivor of 8 years AND a soon to be mommy :)
      I first started fertility treatments with a top doc in Chicago and Abington is so much better.  The nurses are also fabulous.  Know that for any of these centers you have to leave a message for a nurse and they will get back to you but with ALL of my questions I always got a call back the same day and always felt taken care of.

6700051,1,8,CHlhMRatD_Jm9lKUsX-PjQ,"I went there in 2010 in response to an ad for free IVF clinical trial (my last hope after going into debt from 2 previous IVFs).  They billed my insurance company for all of the screening which was allegedly for the trial.  After a procedure (maybe an HSG, I don't remember), moments after removing the speculum, while I'm lying, uncomfortable and mostly naked, on the table in the surgical center, Dr. Somkuti declared me an unfit candidate for the study because of my uterine anomaly. I had been advised by two previous world-renowned  EXCELLENT specialists (on in the Phl area, one at the University of Iowa) that my anomaly had been corrected appropriately and should not be messed with additionally, and that it did not impede my chances for IVF success.  When I expressed that to Somkuti, he seemed to take personal offense that there were other experts out there who might disagree with him and became even more gruff and rude in his proclamation.  I asked to see the photos from the procedure which showed the structural defects, and when they showed them to me it showed no defects at all...because they were showing me the photos from the procedure right before mine and they had ""forgotten"" to take pictures during my procedure so we were looking at someone else's uterus!  Well, that didn't help with votes for credibility for Somkuti, that's for sure!  I was so unimpressed by this place.  

After crying for about an hour in the parking lot before I could even drive, I got on my phone and found out what other sites were conducting the IVF clinical trial.  I immediately contacted the University of Pennsylvania when I discovered they were also a research site for this study.  Within days, I was thoroughly screened for the trial there, qualified with no problem, and completed the IVF cycle there under the study (it's funny, Penn never billed my insurance for all those screening tests...).  

To add insult to injury from Abington Reproductive Medicine, I got a letter from the place a few months later, offering a ""discounted IVF cycle to those who didn't qualify for the IVF study"" that they had screened me for!  Really?  Was that my consolation prize?  Was I supposed to feel so lucky that they were cutting me a break?  What B.S.!  I am so pissed about how they exploited what should be valid research, and played off the fears of desperate, infertile women on their last hope---just to drum up some extra business from the more price-sensitive IVF ""consumer""!  It has taken me this long to be able even to talk about it, but I don't want to see this type of exploitation happen to anyone else.  

I am pretty sure that their practices surrounding the solicitation of participants in the study, the billing of private insurance for the screening process, and the self-serving screening decisions (verdicts) MUST violate the study rules.  My advice for participating in any clinical trials is to do it through an established, non-profit institution of higher education like I eventually did at the University of Pennsylvania.  Any clinic which has to resort to these deceptive marketing practices to generate business (and possibly taint research results) is not a place with whom you should put your trust.",4wuPcxmaE2SGQ0a4TPmXew,1.0,2017-02-24 16:37:18,QHVLPIrxFikklIF9gu1E3A,0,2017-02-24 16:37:18

Yes I still stop in here, it's nearby. However nothing has changed since my last review and major inventory problems, worse than ever now. 

But after stopping in here on July 10 picking up what I COULD find, I head to the register. As usual just one person working an actual register (not even sure why they bother with 12-13 checkouts that are all closed), the self checkouts of course are all open. 

And ONCE AGAIN I scanned an item that was clearly on display on sale $0.88 for Vitamin Water comes up $0.99 cents! I can't you how many times the incorrect sale - make that NO sale price scans into the system. 

If you do not pay attention, and look at the screen after you scan -  you will walk out paying more than what was clearly advertised! Year its a nickel or dime or more off that advertised ""sale price"" Take all that change and all the people who may be paying full price, it adds up BIG TIME! Target has been pulling this nonsense for years, it's to the point I take a photo with my phone and if it fails to scan the price, I'll call one of the employees and point it out.

These people just plain do not have their act together.  Their level of communication was poor, they missed one schedule commitment after another, were unfamiliar with certain Pennsylvania state requirements, and even screwed up the date on which the closing was to take place.  The realtor in the transaction -- an experienced broker at one of the biggest and most respected real estate firms in the Philadelphia area -- was representing both parties, which put her between a rock and a hard place.  At many points during this very frustrating process, she tried to convince the buyers to switch to a more reliable mortgage lender, even though (as I understand it) they were feeling the pain as well through this bank's ceaseless demands for more and more paperwork from them.  But they would not change, so we had to see the process through.  Through the realtor's perseverance, we finally got it over the finish line -- almost two weeks after the date that BB&T represented to us as their targeted settlement date.

6755826,0,4,h_x4VBe_Z6kOAPIhD5PlRA,"Stopped by two weeks ago for a much needed cut and color. I was used to traveling to Philly for a $300 color job that needed to be retouched every month, but after researching salons near me, I came across ARTE. I didn't know what to expect but the reviews here were very much positive so I trusted that I would be in good hands. 

I really hated my long, dry hair (especially for the summer) and I wanted to chop it up to above my shoulders. Although I didn't get the length I wanted in the end, I'm happy with the medium-length cut I received because it suits me perfectly. Maybe I'll experiment with shorter styles in my next appointment--for now though, I'm satisfied. I didn't even have to ask for a layered cut that wasn't just sliced straight across (which seems to be the standard for most American salons); my stylist cut it perfectly. I've never had such silky hair, and I don't even need to style it in the morning for it to look good. She said I didn't need to come back for a few months, which is a relief since I'm constantly busy teaching and studying!

I had an overgrown balayage/ombre with black roots, which my stylist dyed to a lighter brown. Now, my ends are so ashy they're almost gray, which creates a natural, pretty ombré. Both the cut and the dye took around three hours, and costed half of what I would usually pay (tip not included) at a salon in Philly. 

They were very friendly and accommodating, and the salon was clean and modern. You get a locker to put your things in, and a tray for your phone and other essential belongings. They also stick a plastic guard to keep the products from splashing onto your face.

6762751,0,4,Z2o4HET7eOCMPsJM7V9FeQ,"I'm a 22 year old female. After I chopped my hair into a short bob with my own hands, I've been struggling to find the right place to go to fix it up. After going to two other salons, who did not give me what I wanted, I decided to give ARTE a shot (one of my friends who got a digital perm recommended it to me). By the time I got to ARTE, my hair was truly a complete mess. I've dyed my hair twice at home and had cut it on my own as well, so you could imagine just how horrible my hair was. On my first visit, she cut, dyed, and gave me a hair nutrient treatment (not sure exactly what it's called). Throughout the hair treating process, she constantly made sure she was giving me what I wanted without pressuring me to do other random things I didn't want. The place is owned and managed by mother and daughter, who obviously can communicate with each other and to their clients professionally and kindly. Amazing compliments from literally everyone I saw all throughout the week.

Today was my second visit (photos posted!), and I decided to get the Korean Magic. Not a lot of non-Asians know about this but it's pretty much a straightening perm that lasts forever (or at least 6 months). So for someone who has super frizzy hair that folds and bends in all sorts of directions, this perm is a must. I get it at least once every two years to keep my hair manageable. It took relatively shorter than other places and they took extra care as not to burn me (even made the effort to use varying heat levels depending on how damaged each portion of my hair was). Needless to say, they truly care about their clients and satisfaction. After many disappointments at many other hair salons, ARTE Salon is the place I will be returning to for cuts, colors, and perms. Highly recommend! :)",pQTXVYFdIVtHPzVUm3W7qw,5.0,2015-09-26 23:12:01,x7d-kJvkKPjgh3t9magcmQ,3,2015-09-26 23:12:01

Compared to the cemeteries found in Hawaii, this place is huge!

The grounds are full of trees both big and small, shrubbery, weedy grass, and is overall very lush when the weather is fair.

You'll see all sorts of headstones, crypts, and mausoleums in different colors and shapes from the plain and simple, to the big and triumphant, some looking like Asian palaces lol.  There's even a ""Chinatown"" in here from what I observed. 

Maintenance at the facility needs lots of attention. Quite a few headstones were visibly sinking, unaligned, and crooked.  There are a lack of trash cans so the dumping grounds ends up being under the trees at the base of the trunks.

I went to Arte Salon for the first time in June '15 after one of my friends had gotten the digital rolling perm done here.  I was so impressed with the results that I had to try it myself.

The salon is owned and run by a very warm and caring mother & daughter.  The daughter is the main hair stylist, and I was very impressed with her overall service, skills, and knowledge.  As she was doing my hair, she was sharing great hair care and styling tips.  She was so energetic that it made the time fly (digital perms take about 3.5+ hours depending on your hair type).  

It wasn't until the end of my appointment that she shared with me that she started out as a hair colorist.  Out of curiosity, I pulled up a picture of a grey balayage ombre that I was thinking of trying out.  She took one look, and confidently told me that she can do it... but she also told me to really think hard about it because I would be doing a lot of damage to my hair (my hair is BLACK).

After a couples month, I went back in October to get my first hair coloring session done.  Before she started, she explained to me her plan and even considered my budget, which was extremely thoughtful... She assured me that she would take my black hair and get me the grey balayage ombre I wanted in only 2 sessions!

Ambiance: decor is simple and clean and I did feel relaxed being there. They offered refreshments, which was nice. The music in the background was also calming.

Prices: Much less expensive than what I paid last time I did this. Considering the results and amount of time spent, it's a good deal.

Stylist: The owner was very friendly and accomodating to my needs. She seems to be a bit of a perfectionist, so she wants to get it just right. She is good about asking what you want to do as well as providing feedback for what might look best.

Overall, a great experience. I have really long hair that is pretty frizzy and can be hard to work with sometimes so I'm happy with the results. For people who think this is high maintenance, I beg to differ- It took me 5 minutes to do my hair this morning. Love the convenience! Highly recommend.

Dr. Nichols is top notch. I tend to be very nervous with medical procedures and she really went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable.  She is so caring and really gets to know each patient personally. I really appreciate that! I feel the same way about Dr. Sobel. I only saw him a few times but he always remembered me. The nurses are also very kind and good at what they do.  I recommend the Langhorne office where I went most often for regular appointments.  I tried to only go to Abington Hospital if I had to due to lack of appointments closer to home, or because it was a visit for a surgical procedure which they only do at the hospital.  At the hospital you have to pay to park and if you get there a little bit later, parking is hard to come by. I also found it hard to navigate the hospital. But overall - I want to reiterate that this is a wonderful practice.  If billing is your only issue you're doing great.  I had previously gone to a competing practice and the level of personal care from the doctors here was just amazing by comparison. Also, my first IVF was a success and I now have a beautiful 11 month old daughter. 

I would like to respond to Jane S's comment and let everyone know that I always saw Dr. Nichols as well as other doctors (not just nurses) at the Langhorne location.

Taste was better than most local places, if only more than slightly. It did seem made from fresher ingredients, but not to the point where the smaller portions were deserving of the higher prices. To wit, the string beans and shrimp, a combo version was of course expectedly smaller than an entree portion, but not this small. A grand total of three shrimp, and a portion of wonton soup a third the size of other restaurants in the area. Both the entrees were smaller than expected and smaller in comparison, including a surprisingly small amount of chicken in the lo mein. Additionally, there were no extras included in the order... no fortune cookies, no crispy noodles, no duck sauce.

6824534,1,4,prPNLCR8ZKNcsUs5jjWcGg,"We went to ARM about 8 months ago when we realized something was off. Based on our Diagnostic testing, IVF was the only option for us. Dr. Budinetz is was wonderful in terms of keeping us motivated feeling positive and being straightforward with our treatment plan. Unfortunately after 2 failed cycles... our treatment became more complex eventhough we were given the impression it was a textbook case and not really that complicated. I think people need to realize that when you're dealing with reproductive doctors....because everything is based on timing and your schedule of when you ovulate, your doctor may not always be available. This is going to be true for any practice. You have to be comfortable with communicating with the nurses. And trust that your doctor is over seeing it. My biggest problem with ARM is the billing department and the business aspect of the practice. They are completely disorganized, make mistakes, and make an already emotionally-charged situation worse. You really need to stay on top of them and know your information and advocate for yourself. We ultimately switched to a different practice and got a second opinion because we felt that our case was just a number and there wasn't enough individual attention. Especially when things got complicated and weren't going as expected. The worst part was that after a second IVF cycle that was a disaster.... not a single doctor called me to follow up. This is just bad bedside manner when you are paying these prices privately or through insurance. IVF is tricky to begin with because everyones body is different...the question you need to focus on is.... do all patients receive the same protocols and when things don't go right,do they have options to change their protocols with your treatment plan... For our case....this definitely was not true. 

On the flip side...i have two friends that were successful with IUI and one that just needed a boost with clomid. They all complained about the billing department and overall logistics of the practice.

Just to start the story my girlfriend and I ordered from here and it took a little bit long but no big deal.  We got our food, the salad was delicious, the pork bao buns were just eh (no sauce on them). Then we open the container to the sushi (they were both in one container) - we got Hawaiian roll and the Forrest roll (with salmon and mango sauce on top).

Immediately it reeked of bad fish. We were gagging at the smell. So, being in the restaurant industry in the past, I calmly call the restaurant and tell them about the bad salmon on the sushi and the lady is very rude. After starting to argue she says that she will compensate me for one roll. I tell her that the two rolls were in one container and if there is one bad that means that both are bad. She hangs up!

I call back and SHE IGNORES MY CALL.

I had to use my house phone just to get back in touch and I told her that I am a reasonable person and that if she compensates me for the two sushi rolls - I would be happy. She hangs up again.

For the next hour and a half I called 25 times and each time I either was hung up on, called busy, or got a really loud beeping noise.

The staff seemed nice and the doctor I saw was great. What is unacceptable is what happened with the lady that checks the eligibility of their patients. When I made the appointment I explained to them that I had called my insurance company and was told that I do not have a deductible and that the office visit was covered along with ALL diagnostic testing. The girl that answered the phone and made my appointment told me that she would make a note of this.
I went in for my appointment and saw the doctor and had some testing done. After I was done they took me to a small room and told me to wait. Some woman comes in and tells me that when checking my eligibility a FEW DAYS BEFORE my appointment she was told that I in fact did have a deductible and that none of my services were going to be covered. She refused to provide me with the representative at my insurance company that supposedly gave her this false information. I however provided her with the representative that I had spoke to and requested that she call while I was present and put them on speaker. She refused to do so. I work in the medical field and check patient eligibility on a daily basis. It is completely unacceptable to wait until the patient is seen and have tests performed to tell them that their appointment isn't going to be covered when you knew before the patient arrived even if this was true. That's like telling a patient after they are seen that they don't have a referral for their visit. 
She then proceeds to tell me that I will have to pay for my entire visit. I told her that I was going to call my insurance company back and file a complaint against the office. When I got home I did just exactly that and guess what. The insurance company said they had no record of the office calling them and told me that I DID NOT have to pay a dime other than my $20 copay. I called the office back and asked for the manager. I explained the situation to her and she was NO HELP AT ALL. All she kept saying was that I was responsible for the bill. I told her I wasn't paying it because I WASN'T responsible for it. I even offered to conference call my insurance company to clear things up and she refused. DO NOT go here.

However, to be fair, this restaurant isn't authentic Thai restaurant to start with, so maybe asking for something close to thai food may have been too much. The food tasted bland, and when I asked the pad thai to be made spicy, instead of adding spice they gave me a small bottle of siracha.  I think that says a lot.

Dr. Nichols is the doctor I met with. Although she is very nice, she rushed through my appointment and talked about so many things that i couldn't keep up. So far we tried naturally with clomid and ovulation shot, but we have not conceived. My cervical biopsy was ""inconclusive"", so it was recommended I have a d&c. They were not sympathetic to my situation, did not seem to care that this news was upsetting to me, and told me over and over how ""common"" this is. I'm sure they were trying to be helpful, but I have no experience with other clinics, am trying to have a baby for the first time in my life, and I am scared. Dr. Nichols called me to give me the biopsy results, but I couldn't answer at work, and when I called the office back, I was told she would call me back in 2 days because she would be out of the office. The administrative staff does not care about your schedule; they expect you to drop everything immediately for bloodwork appointments, testing, and now my d&c. There is no compassion, no signs that they will help you figure it out, and they are very dismissive. Even the voicemail line is dismissive and abrupt. It tells you blatantly ""do not call and leave multiple messages"" and ""if you call after 4pm, your call will be returned the next day"". They also leave voicemails during the day, and you can never, ever get a real person on the phone. I work full-time in a very non-flexible environment, so I can't take phone calls all day long, but when you call back to speak to someone, you are forced to either explain your entire history to someone you have not spoken to before, or have to leave ANOTHER message. You never get to speak directly to a nurse at the location you are attending; it is always a nurse from another office, who you never met, and is very abrupt and rushes you off of the phone.

Now, being a bit of a ramen snob I went at this piece by piece.  They don't use authentic ramen, so the pasta began to give off an almost wheat like flavor...hard to describe..like if you cook pasta too long...that flavor.

Staff for the most part is very pleasant. Unfortunately I had a mishap at the Langhorne location with billing some how I was not informed of a large bill, which granted me and my husband were told in the very beginning about 4 months ago fast fwd to now ""out of sight out of mind"". Long story short I was not even suppose to start my 3rd cycle because my 2nd wasn't paid for, we did get small bills sent via mail to our home but this last cycle we decided to do the FSH syringes and the amount was pretty large compared to the 3-digit bills we were receiving in the mail. One morning I was in the office and before I left the lady at front desk says to me ""You have a bill for $_,_ _ _ and if you don't pay it unfortunately will not be seen again"".....her delivery was very unpleasant and for her to put my information out in the open was very unprofessional. I told her I was not aware of such large amount and asked for a receipt, she said she didn't have one and that I needed to call billing.
The most annoying part of this entire ordeal is that everyone me and my husband spoke to put the blame on someone else and washed their hands. I was not looking to blame anyone but I did want to make them aware of the miscommunication that occurred so it won't happen to anyone else. The excuse billing gave me was that front desk at the Langhorne office should have made me aware but because I was always in for my blood work at 7-7:30am the receptionist did not get in til after I had already left. So my response to that was well don't they have all my contact info in case they can't get a hold of me in person. So then billing person says to me well you did sign a form in the beginning, which indicates the large amount that is now due...and yes I did but that was 4 months ago (I honestly did not think it was going to take this long to still try and get pregnant). She even admitted to me she was not sure why I was even aloud to start my 3rd cycle with a pending bill. Somewhere along the lines someone dropped the ball and it made this whole process more stressful then it already is :(

I really don't want to review this place low but... So my first time at this salon last year was amazing!!! I loved the place, the service was great and she was very professional and super kind... still super nice and kind but I got the same treatment this time around and the results was not anything like the first time. The service was good but the result was terrible! I don't understand what she did because my hair looks exactly the same before I went! I even paid more for a ""recommended touch up""... the first time I went I paid $300 for the straight perm and my hair went 2 inches past my shoulders. It came out super straight and silky for almost an entire year! Loved it! The second time I go she recommends just a touch up and I was like are you sure my hair isn't super straight like before and she said it's so it doesn't get crispy and damaged... I took her advice because I don't know, this was only my second time with this. Then she tells me when I pay that it will be 350! I'm confused because she only did my roots and that didn't even go past my ears and last year it was 300 to do my hair that went past my shoulders... after I washed my hair a couple of days later my hair was so frizzy! The roots were smooth but underneath that area it was so frizzy... I called her and she said it will even out... it did not but worse 3 weeks later my top looks like how it started and my hair is not how it should be... I spent most of last year just getting up and brushed it a little bit and go. It was awesome. Now I have to put smoothing cream on my hair to keep it smoothish and try to make it look straight! It's bad especially when you feel like you wasted $350 for nothing. I'd rather spend the extra $50 to get my entire hair done so it would be straight and smooth... I'm so mad every time I look at my hair in the morning because I have to do my hair when I shouldn't have too:(  the picture is of one of last year where it was like that most of the year, the others are with smoothing cream to tame it.

6980876,0,4,rHufxITEg14ww12puhZfFg,"I went to Ban Ban during it's grand opening and was nothing but impressed!! I knew that I wasn't going to have a typical Chinese dining experience as soon as I walked into a bright, modern and friendly atmosphere and was greeted as soon as I stepped in. I was excited about the menu and specialty drinks like bubble teas and smoothies since you can't get anything like that in the nearby area! As for the food I was able to try not only my order but my friends due to the sharing style dining experience. I highly recommend the soft shell crab, which is a lightly fried and seasoned crab that you can eat whole, which I ate the whole plate of!! This is now my new Asian food hot spot and my family now orders take out from Ban Ban instead of our boring,lifeless, chicken and broccoli from our old take out place.",ETZK5PuCsVfQ7ElXckDTPw,5.0,2016-01-19 00:13:17,-Ru24avp9ROMbImFTrHfRA,0,2016-01-19 00:13:17
6981423,1,3,XAjV_jlK0OQw3zkM6RBkxg,This place is ridiculous. 4 people on the sandwich board and nothing coming out. There is maybe one competent person working here right now.

Boy was I wrong. They were so busy trying to fulfill the Drive thru orders that it was almost 15 minutes to get my food. I stood here for 8 minutes before I was even acknowledged.",rkqsFfbdeuXevR4Z3VgFuA,3.0,2016-10-18 12:47:06,TtuLyYy4Gf41XA2JUQgY8A,0,2016-10-18 12:47:06
6984815,0,3,H5-ABXJgVRYow2fOU2qIyQ,"Ban Ban was pretty good. Good service. Clean. Tasty food.

Korean Wings: more sweet than spicy. I enjoyed them. Come with Kim Chi on the side.
Mongolian Lamb: Good flavor, nice veg, but too oily for me.
Drunken noodles: the winner of the night.

We will likely be back. The food is fun to eat. Really modern vibe.",ETZK5PuCsVfQ7ElXckDTPw,4.0,2016-07-07 13:46:20,mm6E4FbCMwJmb7kPDZ5v2Q,0,2016-07-07 13:46:20
6985763,3,1,EAueNdvhbv6S2Vc08-kDFw,"Ordered delivery over an hour ago (1 hour and 30 minutes to be exact) and it's still not here. Called the restaurant and the lady was NOT FRIENDLY AT ALL. She rudely said ""it's on its way"" 

Last time I ordered from this place, they forgot my bubble tea and they were late and the food was flavorless and not good at all. (WE COULDN'T EVEN SAVE THE FOOD WITH SRIRACHA) My husband told me not to order from this place because of our last experience but I wanted to give it another chance. BIG MISTAKE. As a business owner, at least have a common courtesy to apologize when the food is coming late! Like I always drive by this place and it is NEVER busy and I don't understand why it takes them this long to make 2 dishes and 1 side dish and if they are slow at cooking or whatever and the food isn't that good, at least be friendly! WILL NEVER EVER ORDER OR EAT FROM THIS PLACE AGAIN!

UPDATE! 

OUR FOOD FINALLY CAME!! Hallelujah! At least the delivery person apologized. But can someone please explain to me why they only gave us one chopstick? Just Don't give us anything!!!Let me just use my one chopstick to eat my cold soup and my husband can have it after I am done to eat his food sigh",ETZK5PuCsVfQ7ElXckDTPw,1.0,2017-04-01 01:05:46,efoFHUP08msKW73LPkZxWA,2,2017-04-01 01:05:46
