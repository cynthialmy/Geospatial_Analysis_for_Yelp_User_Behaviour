I feel like I've spent most of my life in salons trying to explain to someone how to cut my curls and always left in tears or frustrated.  Yuko system gave me a chance to manage and like my hair.

He did a large variety of work for us including drywall repair, pressure washing the patio and drive way, sanding and painting, some landscaping design and removal of shrubs.  His pressure washing removed oil stains and bits of tar from the driveway. He sprayed one side of the house with a light bleach solution to remove some mold.  He made everything look brand new.  He also repaired a delicate, broken antique mirror and hung it for us. We found him to be very reasonably priced and he made a lot of suggestions that ended up saving us hundreds of dollars.  We did some work ourselves and he did what we were not able to do.  Even on work that  only we did he made suggestions on materials and methods that saved us money.

5141851,0,8,II05byXIS4Wtb_Xs4z0Wng,"You know the saying, ""it is hard to find good help"". Well, guess I lucked out when I found, Ken. 

I had just picked up a rescue dog and wanted the luxury of having a doggie door. My one obstacle was that I had an indoor cat. I needed to find a person who would not only install the doggie door (not a very hard task), but also build an enclosure of sorts to contain the cat! Ken was the ""go to person"".  He was able to help assess the situation, price out the materials, and give me a very reasonable quote. He performed the task and the result is a very professional enclosure completely made out of wood with a beautiful gate, all hand-painted.  The end product is far better than I had imagined!

In contrast, I had called a number of other ""handymen"", fencing companies, and specialized gate businesses. One of the better known ""handymen"" went so far to ask me if I loved my pets. If I did love them then I'd better be willing to open up my pocketbook. 

The classic answer these other businesses gave to solve the problem was to slap together a classic metal gate with a post on one end with the other attached to the wall (Ken actually built a door-frame out of wooden posts with both cemented into the ground prior attaching the gate). Then to keep the cat inside they would have stretched chain-link across the top. Of course this all was going to not only be makeshift, but expensive.

Ken was personable, knowledgeable, and very reasonably priced. I highly recommend him for ANY task whether it was to build or repair. Ken doesn't seem to care if it is a large job or a very small job.

Danny answered the phone and I couldn't even finish telling him concerns as soon as I said the word issues he started yelling at me, not raising his voice, not just changing his tone but full on yelling. He called me a liar for saying he quotes me 5 HR move and stated that because I am unorganized it took longer and that his workers took so long because they had to pack smaller boxes into bigger ones, which I had no idea they were doing as all my item were already packed in store (the larger boxes they used were $12 each, I was not told this or about the boxes) Danny then accused me of having this planned because I can't afford the payment and informed me he would be taking me to court and suing me since I refused to pay (which I did not, as they were in the middle of the move still) He called me demanding and said I needed to hang up and calm down and call in a couple days. I then asked about me paying for my movers lunch break, Danny stated they did take one. They movers told us that they had, I informed Danny of that and he again called me a liar and told me if I was having an issue I needed to talk to my crew about it since I was paying and he wasn't there. He refused pictures of the damages and said he needed to see them in person. I asked him to come out right then and he laughed at me and said he was done for the day and he couldn't come out Monday before 10am as he has a life and a kid. I have never been treated or spoken to that way by anyone much less a business owner. I will update on Monday after Danny has seen the damages.

Just a quick update: Daniel is not coming to look at the damage in person. He is instead blaming the customer (as he has done in EVERY negative review on here) and threatening to take customers to court. Please beware of this company and the owner. Customer service is something they do not care about.",CVXPA2pB9YWJWwUGl_cECg,1.0,2016-06-12 16:30:43,hfflnks_VHyyRuqxw86YLQ,0,2016-06-12 16:30:43

My move occurred on June 17th and Rodney, Luis, and Gerald were the best guys for the job. I am glad they were assigned to my moving day because they were extremely professional and paid attention to every detail. They would check in with me on the littlest thing and always kept me in the loop of what was going on. They loaded my items with so much care that I wasn't worried about anything getting damaged or moving around in the truck during travel. My move to my new home was just 15 minutes away but they respected my items as if it were going cross country. I also made sure that I kept these guys hydrated because it was really hot that day and they were very consistent in getting the job done.

I rescheduled my meetings just for this move.  My friend was with me and heard the entire conversation.  She told me she would also arrange her schedule so she could be there to help out.
Danny said they would be at my office at 8am. He seemed very pleasant and I was happy to know my move would be taken care of.  I even called back to confirm at 1:52pm on that same day.

On Monday morning, Jan 23rd, my friend and I arrived early at my office and waited for 45 minutes. No movers showed up at 8am or ever.  I called several times as I waited, but since they do not open until 9am, they did not answer.  Finally, I called yet again and Danny picked up.  

He told me he did not have me on his schedule and never remembered talking to me. He also said something about not scheduling before 9am.  He did not apologize and just told me that he couldn't do anything except talk to his guys after they were finished moving someone else.

I do not recommend Sunshine Movers.  Yet, if you decide to go with them, you may need to call several times to confirm your appointment, and even then you cannot be sure they will show up.

With respect to the work they performed, they arrived early, they quickly set about performing different tasks (one guy dismantled furniture, one guy brought stuff to the truck, and one guy carefully wrapped and loaded the truck to protect our stuff and to maximize space).  

The guys deserve extra credit because we believed that we would need two storage containers to hold our belongings.  The movers utilized every inch of space and were able to safely fit all our stuff into a single container saving us a lot of money.

My guys were great, personable, show up on time (a tad early), etc.  However, they did leave behind two boxes and a bed rail, bed items, a table lamp.   Also, they did scrape the side of my dresser which I noticed after they left so there was nothing I could say.   But considering the tight stairway they had to use, I guess it might be inevitable; although I'm surprised it wasn't covered properly to prevent scraping.  Also a box marked for upstairs was left downstairs and several plastic bins also.  Minor inconvenience.

6669567,0,9,lwXbE3Kv_a3vBzz-46fo3w,"We received a recommendation for Sunshine Movers by friends who recently had a good moving experience with them. Except for when a very expensive table was broken into pieces, the crew of movers from Sunshine Movers were great- they were very conscientious about pointing out pre-existing flaws or damage in furniture and worked really hard and quickly. We were amazed by their strength and ability to navigate a tricky staircase to get my furniture into my new house. However, when it came time to deal with the broken piece of furniture, the tone of the owner, Danny, changed very quickly. Our experience seems very similar to Ter B's recent one star Yelp review for this company. Danny was very defensive from the start and hadn't even come to look at the broken furniture and was already saying that it was not his responsibility since he felt that we had improperly assembled the table and had assisted his movers with lifting the table (at their request). I do appreciate that Danny was willing to meet with us the next day; however, when we did meet the next day, it was not a very pleasant interaction. There was no friendly greeting, little empathy for the damage done, and he continued to reiterate that it was not the responsibility of his company for the damage done to my furniture. After thinking about the situation for a few days and researching the cost of replacing the broken table, we felt that a 50/50 split of the cost was fair. After all, Danny, is a hard working small business owner which we respect and we felt that this was a fair compromise. However, Danny still maintained that his company was at zero percent fault and was surprised that we were even having this discussion. After considering our request, he grudgingly sent us a check for 25% of the cost to replace the table and still maintained that his company was not at any monetary fault. The truck may say fully licensed and insured, but don't let that lead you into a false sense of security. Any argument can be made that it was the owner's fault that their items were damaged due to improper assembly, fabrication, poor craftmanship, unsafe moving environment, etc. If you are looking for good movers who work efficiently and you don't really have any valuable pieces of furniture that you would miss if it were broken, then these are the movers for you. However, if you value any of the items that you are moving and would expect to be compensated fairly for any damage to those items, then BEWARE! Unfortunately, I cannot in good conscience recommend this company to anyone as they do not have ""customer service that shines"" when it comes to anything they damage. In the end, I felt that we treated Danny and his movers with more respect and courtesy that Danny did to us. We provided drinks, lunch, and a tip to each mover on moving day and were very professional with them and never yelled at them despite the loss of our table.

**Please note that their video on this Yelp page also indicates that their ""hourly rate is their hourly rate"" and that ""we don't charge extra for shrink wrap, we don't throw in extra costs for Saturdays or Sundays, we're not hitting you up for stairs..."" Our bill clearly shows that we were charged for 2 rolls of shrink wrap ($40), as well as 3 rolls of tape ($6)... **",CVXPA2pB9YWJWwUGl_cECg,1.0,2015-05-15 03:41:53,9cn7hABBa84rphgoARDOIQ,1,2015-05-15 03:41:53

The other difference was the minimum charge...the other two had a 2 hour minimum, while Sunshine's was 3. Between the amount of stuff we needed moved and the distance (about 8 miles) I was pretty sure it wouldn't take less than 3, and I was right. Exactly 3 hours...and, as promised, no extra charges. They even took my personal check.
I have virtually no complaints about the move. The crew they sent out (Steve, Cedric and Trey) were pleasant, courteous and professional.  They dismantled anything that needed it and rebuilt it at the destination. One quick story: our fridge wouldn't fit through either doorway into the kitchen. Cedric got out his toolkit and removed the fridge doors and replaced them once the fridge was in place.

I went from a 2500 sq foot 4 bedroom to a 1700 sq foot apartment. I didn't even have furniture in all the rooms. It took these guys 8 HOURS!!!!  Yup you read that right, 8 HOURS!!!

I was absolutely shocked! REALLY?!! 

Then one guy breaks my mirror and when I get checked out at the end no one even acknowledges it. And they lost the remote for my TV. I asked them to put it back in the original box but no they insisted to do it their way. Now I have a TV and no remote. That's what I get for being nice. 

So over $1,000 dollars later I'm finally in. But don't worry about marking your boxes, they don't even read them. Kinda just put them down and you have to be on top of them to tell them to put boxes where they belong.

6814841,2,20,mL0U6zbsKB3wVZANXWSQRQ,"I am normally not one to bash companies on the Internet. Usually, if I have a problem with a company they are able to resolve it and offer a solution because that's what good customer service looks like. However, I am so unbelievably upset and disgusted by the way I was treated today by Sunshine Movers. Their motto is ""customer service that shines"" but I received zero customer service. I called around to multiple companies to get quotes and when I first spoke with Danny he was so nice and informative. I explained that we were moving from a storage unit to a 3 bedroom 2 story house with a loft. I explained what kind of furniture we had for each room and he said we should go with a 3 man crew instead of a 2 man crew because it would get done a lot faster (around 4-5 hours). At $130 an hour even that number intimidated me, but we decided to go with them because of the great experience I had had with him so far. Moving day arrives and they get started at 8am. I am watching as they are only loading one or 2 items into the elevator at a time instead of efficiently packing the elevator for each trip down. 2:00 rolls around and they are STILL at the storage unit. We call to see what's going on and they say they're just finishing up the 1st truckload, but that they will have to come back. Once they arrived at my house they would take 1 box at a time and walk it all the way upstairs. How is that efficient at all? They could have made a pile of things that needed to go upstairs or done an assembly line up the stairs. There were many ways to quickly move us in and it seemed like they were taking longer on purpose just to increase the hours. Then, I noticed that things weren't even in the correct rooms. Things labeled ""master bedroom"" we're in My daughter's room which is clearly not the master. Things labeled ""bathroom"" we're in bedrooms and things labeled ""garage"" we're upstairs so that we now had to carry them back downstairs ourselves. I also noticed that there were dings in our brand new painted walls and that multiple items were broken! It's one thing if they accidentally broke something and told us about it, but to act like it never happened is just ridiculous. They also packed some of our things in ""wardrobe"" boxes without informing us that we needed to immediately unpack those and give the boxes back or we would be charged $12 per box. It would've been nice to have been told this in the beginning and we could have easily just moved that stuff ourselves. At this point the job is nearing 12 hours and I am beyond frustrated. I decide to call Danny and let him know what was going on. I start to leave a message and say ""hey, this is Stephanie Roper, we are currently in the middle of a move with you and I have some concerns because we are nearing 12 hours and I was quoted 5..."" He then answers the phone and immediately starts screaming at me. Yes, you read that correctly. The next 20 minute phone call consisted of Danny yelling at me, interrupting me, talking over me, calling me a liar, making degrading comments about how ""he's sure our brand new paint was just flat paint so no wonder it got messed up"", telling me he was going to take me to court, repeating the things I told him and saying he doubts that actually happened, making excuses for why it's ok to just carry 1 box at a time, and accusing me of just trying to call because I didn't have enough to money to pay them. He also said the movers never took a lunch in 12 hours (which is illegal, btw) and when we asked the movers if they took a lunch they said that they did! He then called back and said ""I just want to let you know I wasn't yelling at you""... Oh really, Danny? Because it sure sounded like yelling to me. He made me cry and he literally didn't care at all. He is the rudest and most unprofessional business owner and person that I have ever spoken to in my entire life. I am seriously in shock about the way that I was treated today. I am going to do everything I can to make sure people know NEVER to use Sunshine movers because nobody deserves to be treated like this.

UPDATE: Danny has now responded trying to defend himself by coming back with things that are completely untrue. A true small business owner would not respond via Yelp trying to make themselves look better, but would instead try to solve the problem and apologize for the way they treated their paying customer. He is threatening taking legal action for slander of his business.

That's what appealed the most since my apartment is super small, not a lot of stuff and I'm moving a town over. I get a confirmation email stating the movers will arrive between 8-10am and that they'd call 30 minutes prior to arriving. I figured they wouldn't arrive at 8 but I got up early anyway to get a head start on disassembling stuff. At 9 I get a little concerned and look at my email and see an error. After calling multiple times, I get in contact with someone and they tell me all is well and that they're going to see where the movers are. This is when stuff goes left.

The actual mover calls and says he called me several times yesterday to tell me there's a bit of a delay. Now, I get scam calls and telemarketers calling me all day, multiple times a day and I don't answer unknown phone numbers UNLESS I'm anticipating a phone call (I wasn't, the move was confirmed via phone earlier in the week) and if it's legit, the caller should leave a message. He never left a message. I'm in the middle of a move and packing so it's pretty expected to miss calls, especially ones from unknown numbers. So I ask what the delay will be. He says ""a couple of hours at least."" What the hell!!?! So I say a few not so nice words and he says he'll call management to see what can be done. I receive a call back saying that he's currently trying to find two helpers and will give me an hour of free labor to make up for the inconvenience. That was two hours ago and I have no ETA. To make matters worse, the damn company can't get in touch with the mover to get an ETA either. Am I even moving today? Not sure. TBD. This is extremely unprofessional and unacceptable. Wouldn't recommend them to anyone. I guess I'm getting what I pay for. 

UPDATE:

So I call the mover myself and get an ETA of 5 p.m. SEVEN hours later than my promised time. I wouldn't be surprised if I don't move tonight at all. What was supposed to be a great first day living with my boyfriend has went to hell. Thanks guys. I'll post a final update once this is all over with.

Final update:

Idk the name of any of the movers but they eventually came the following morning and moved me in under 3 hours for free. I felt really bad for yelling at the main guy the previous day because he turned out to be really sweet and efficient. I get the impression that this never ever happens but just my luck it happened to me.

I set up the move for 8am, the first available appointment since moving in the Summer in Vegas is the worse time anyone can move.  At 8 o'clock Tre called me asking how to get to my apt since he lost.  After a couple of more phone calls about my exact location, we found out the manager provided him the wrong address and was on the other side of town.  

Tre was apologetic and waived the transportation fee for the inconveniences.  Him and Larry did a great job, I paid the minimum and gave them a very generous tip. Until Danny called me demanding that I pay the $50 or it will be taken out of the guys pay.  He tried to say ""traffic"" happens,  the fee should have never been waived and nothing in this world is free.  Danny continued to blame his guys and not take any of the responsibility.

They provided 2 wardrobe boxes at no extra charge so I was able to easily pack and unpack a full walk-in closet within 3 minutes total.

There were many ways to quickly move us in and it seemed like they were taking longer on purpose just to increase the hours. Then, I noticed that things weren't even in the correct rooms. Things labeled ""master bedroom"" we're in My daughter's room which is clearly not the master. Things labeled ""bathroom"" we're in bedrooms and things labeled ""garage"" we're upstairs so that we now had to carry them back downstairs ourselves. I also noticed that there were dings in our brand new painted walls and that multiple items were broken! It's one thing if they accidentally broke something and told us about it, but to act like it never happened is just ridiculous. They also packed some of our things in ""wardrobe"" boxes without informing us that we needed to immediately unpack those and give the boxes back or we would be charged $12 per box. It would've been nice to have been told this in the beginning and we could have easily just moved that stuff ourselves. At this point the job is nearing 12 hours and I am beyond frustrated. I decide to call Danny and let him know what was going on. I start to leave a message and say ""hey, this is Stephanie Roper, we are currently in the middle of a move with you and I have some concerns because we are nearing 12 hours and I was quoted 5..."" He then answers the phone and immediately starts screaming at me. Yes, you read that correctly. The next 20 minute phone call consisted of Danny yelling at me, interrupting me, talking over me, calling me a liar, making degrading comments about how ""he's sure our brand new paint was just flat paint so no wonder it got messed up"", telling me he was going to take me to court, repeating the things I told him and saying he doubts that actually happened, making excuses for why it's ok to just carry 1 box at a time, and accusing me of just trying to call because I didn't have enough to money to pay them. He also said the movers never took a lunch in 12 hours (which is illegal, btw) and when we asked the movers if they took a lunch they said that they did! He then called back and said ""I just want to let you know I wasn't yelling at you""... Oh really, Danny? Because it sure sounded like yelling to me. He made me cry and he literally didn't care at all. He is the rudest and most unprofessional business owner and person that I have ever spoken to in my entire life. I am seriously in shock about the way that I was treated today. I am going to do everything I can to make sure people know NEVER to use Sunshine movers because nobody deserves to be treated like this.",CVXPA2pB9YWJWwUGl_cECg,1.0,2016-06-12 04:39:18,n5SKTM6sFVCXiB8gLBUuKg,0,2016-06-12 04:39:18

6957532,2,5,NG9eoEl0mXj-7AHEXXQeHg,"My experience with Sunshine Movers was exceedingly positive from beginning to end. 

I began by speaking with Danny who helped me schedule my time, gave me upfront no-nonsense pricing, and told me what to expect. Danny gave me a courtesy call the day before my move to make sure nothing had changed and confirmed my appointment. 

On the day of my move Trey and Jacob showed up 20 mins early eager to work. They took the time to walk through my belongings and were very attentive as I gave them instructions on what to and what to not take. They showed my belongings the utmost respect and care when packing everything into the truck. They wrapped more fragile items in plastic and moving blankets. 

After leaving my old property, Trey and Jacob drove to my new place (and beat me there!) and again listened attentively on where to place and orient items. 

I could not be more impressed with the level of service I received from Sunshine Movers. I will absolutely be recommending them to every person that needs help moving. I can't sing their praises high enough - don't hire anyone but Sunshine Movers and be sure to ask for Trey and Jacob!",CVXPA2pB9YWJWwUGl_cECg,5.0,2017-01-19 01:36:35,HFdLRhmYRFd0LJhQGulcIQ,8,2017-01-19 01:36:35

We had a 12-24 hr window to move the furniture. Sunshine gave us a 2 hour start time window 9-11, not only didn't they show up, we could never get them to call us back to say what happened.

Larry, Cedric, and Tre showed up on time.  They were nice, professional, and funny.  They took apart some of the larger items, and put them together when they delivered everything to my place.   The price was incredibly reasonable for 3 guys.  They did everything in 2 hours.  There was a small transportation fee, but if it had taken 3 hours they said they would waive that.  

My sister was with me.  She had some great conversations with the guys.  She even said she will use them when she moves again! 

GREAT JOB Sunshine Movers!  You gave me a wonderful experience and I will be sure to call you when I need help again!",CVXPA2pB9YWJWwUGl_cECg,5.0,2016-08-24 18:55:55,O7KciodvbNSfi0FqcbotYw,4,2016-08-24 18:55:55
6967663,0,1,h5e2YhBsXZ88orsUPvNatA,"Moving in the middle of the summer in Las Vegas is not the most ideal situation.  However, Sunshine Movers turned my worst case scenario into the most stress-free and pleasant moving experience I have ever had.  The men who came to move my belongings - Trey and Pele - made me feel comfortable from beginning to end.  

These two young gentlemen were polite, professional, helpful, knowledgeable and extraordinarily careful with my belongings.  They never deliberately dragged their feet to pad their time, or took unnecessary smoke breaks, and I stayed well within my moving budget.  Nothing was broken, or ""lost.""  I had marked all my boxes with the rooms they were supposed to go into and they followed it to the letter, so everything ended up exactly where it should be. 

I would absolutely recommend Sunshine Movers to anyone moving in Las Vegas.  They know what they're doing and won't try to rip you off with unnecessary fees and charges.",CVXPA2pB9YWJWwUGl_cECg,5.0,2015-06-17 18:36:39,FiqZauu4UX0XlhOPirdzkQ,0,2015-06-17 18:36:39

Hours from the time they wrapped up all my rooms and loaded the truck.    Not to mention they were so friendly and courteous and made my move so easy.  I even had a large granite table that I know weighed a ton and they handled moving it with no problems.  I commend them for doing such a great job and highly recommend using them for any and all your moves.

6971000,3,5,r53IJ1JFpl1qymUnmvXLWw,"I received this company's name from a Friend Elie Monday Dec 5th.  I called that day and spoke to Danny.  We spoke about how many people he would recommend for moving our 3500 square foot home.  He recommended at the time to get 3 men, I was not certain but when they came and moved, I was extremely happy with him recommending 3.  We booked them for Thursday Dec 8th at 8 AM.  They arrived on time and Cedric, Larry and Rodney all showed up ready to move us.  They were all polite, funny and really cared about our items and asked us where things would go.  They helped even pack some items we did not get a chance to pack.  They moved some large items for us, such as a side by side beverage cooler.  Everything made it in one piece and Cedric even put my queen bed together for me, which helped out a lot.  You are the best Cedric!!!!   

I would highly recommend this company.  They came prepared with boxes, stretch wrap, dollies, ramps and other things that avoided damaged both homes.  Moving is a very stressful process for family's and Sunshine Movers made it very easy.  Thank you Danny to you and your crew, FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY.  Last, they were very reasonably priced.

6980362,0,4,vk6tCKwCRDwrjEMC2aZD5A,"My husband and I were moving to Florida and needed help with packing the truck. I figured we should hire professionals to pack the truck as we didn't know how to properly pack a truck ourselves and thought this would be the best way to make sure our items arrived safely.

On 4/23/16 Rodney and Dave showed up a little past the scheduled time, but they called ahead to let us know so that was fine. When they arrived they were very courteous and professional. We went through the house so they could see all the items that needed to get loaded on the truck. It took them five hours to load the truck, but I figured they were packing everything nicely so I was okay with the extra time. We provided 36 blankets to protect our wood furniture.

I thought everything was fine until we got to Florida and discovered a significant amount of our items were scratched and boxes marked fragile were quite crushed as well. I haven't made it through opening all the boxes yet so I don't know what kind of damage happened there but I took pictures of all the furniture and my treadmill that got damaged.

On 5/5/16 I called Sunshine Movers and the guy basically said, sorry, there is nothing they will do and that it could be my fault for not providing enough blankets (we had 36 of them) or it could have been the unloaders, even though I watched them take everything out and they did so carefully.

So I paid almost $500 to have my furniture not be packed and protected properly. My suggestion is save your money and just do it yourself. You will probably do a better job because you care about your items. Or perhaps they just don't know how to pack properly for such a long haul and might do okay for an in town job.",CVXPA2pB9YWJWwUGl_cECg,2.0,2016-05-05 18:52:44,Sqd6-nf0gOnMAkE5tPS-FA,0,2016-05-05 18:52:44
