There were absolutely no signs directing you  to the drivers test area.  We had to walk inside, where he told us to drive up the ramp at the end of the building and look for the test administrator standing on the concrete.  We did so three times and never saw the guy.  Fifteen minutes later we spotted another employee walking outside who pointed to the correct area of the parking lot where there were a few cones and concrete barriers.  Why didn't the guy inside just say that?  You don't go up the ramp - you basically follow the parking lot around!  The test administrator was nice enough, except that he complained that he didn't have room to get out of the car where he told my son to park.  Inside, my 16 year old was met with rudeness and scolding for not knowing his social security number.  What 16 year old does?  All in all, the same old DMV experience.  A bunch of  state employees who treat you like crap because there's not a darn thing you can do about it!

They keep extra employees in the building so they can have each others backs in case a confrontation erupts. 

On the multiple occasions I've been there I've seen large confrontations from customers with the employees. The employees have a lot of attitude, and they chime into each others conversation if they overhear something that interests them. 

With me personally, they treated me with disrespect. I am a white male and most of the employees here are black, so I don't know, it may be a racial thing. One employee demanded that I ""Sit down!"" Another employee cut up my license I just showed them, and it was valid.

My advice is to keep to yourself, mind your own, don't look anyone in the eye, and only speak when spoken to in this place.

Photo center is in a separate building from everything else. A huge room with dozens of chairs lined up,usually filled with miserable,impatient and/or totally aloof people, almost always texting or taking photos of themselves while they wait their turn.

3924520,0,3,vlRtkak78ISf2_x9RGuo4Q,"If PENNDot were a competitive business, it would be out of business. Unfortunately it's frowned upon in PA to buy your drivers license from anywhere else, so you have to come and visit one of these from time to time.

Now pity me, because as a short-term visa holder I have to come every year, rather than every 4 years. I'm not allowed to use the internet-based system to renew. And because I don't have a check book, I have to come in, wait in line, find out how much they decide it will cost, drive to the bank, have them create a money order, drive back, wait in line, provide a ton of information, get in a new line to get a photo, and go and drink my sorrows.

I waste 6 hours each year on this madness.

My favorite part is when my visa expires, my drivers license expires, and then whilst I await the paperwork from the department of state, PENNDot won't renew my drivers license. What exactly am I supposed to do during this 3 week period? Hire a limo driver? Hole myself up in the basement?

In the end I don't know why I'm bothering to write this review because the people who run this center are paid to run a process. To their credit, they don't do such a bad job at running a farcical process. They're not bad people.

3931256,1,13,toUmc7jC45eBHlAfbKrs1w,"My experience here just blew my mind, and not in a good way. The people working here are clearly miserable in life, and frankly, I would be too if I would spend 40 hours a week in this dump. 

Nonetheless... Took my knowledge test here after moving to the area from Amsterdam. The test was (obviously) pretty straight forward, but the people at the desk are just unfriendly, rude and not helpful at all in answering any of your questions. 

Then... I also took my road test here. Or actually, I didn't, because I failed parallel parking. Had an appointment for 10:30am but don't count on taking your test on time, cause you'll have to wait forever anyway. The guy judging my driving (or better said, parking) was such an A-hole! Contemplating on whether I should mention his name or not... I know you do the same freakin' thing every single day, but do you really have to be like that? Talking like a machine, having this sense of power over his face. He clearly (a little too clearly) loves to have this power because he's clearly the type of person to be picked on at school. 

Drove my car within the lines without bumping into the poles, needed 1 turn more than the max of 3 turns. And that was it. He took about 2 seconds to explain why I failed and stepped out of my car. 

This same guy also failed the guy who went before me, so I guess he was into it for the day. 

It just amazes me how you get treated here, and it's something I've never experienced before. I know more people who have failed at this DMV, people who are all experienced drivers, so from what I hear (and experienced), they're super strict here. 

Not keen on going back here, and will try to go somewhere else in hopes of finding a friendlier environment. Wish me luck!",pn3NGJP8X6SqWQAiN7DM5w,1.0,2014-09-04 02:45:18,yxrDIW0b823PhQTZ0Q1KcA,2,2014-09-04 02:45:18

Everyone has a neutral sort of look and then when they see how crazy it is in here the look of defeat washes over them and it makes me smile. So about the center...., the seating is limited and I'm guessing because the chairs are so nice they couldn't afford to buy a lot. Another feature of this place is all the florescent lighting! Who likes natural light anyway - can I get a what what!?!? Also you will look forward to the bathroom here; there is one for everyone to share and who doesn't love sharing.

Seriously great job on that you guys or girls nailed that!!!! As for the two people behind the counter taking care of all these people you guys do a great job (this isn't sarcasm).
