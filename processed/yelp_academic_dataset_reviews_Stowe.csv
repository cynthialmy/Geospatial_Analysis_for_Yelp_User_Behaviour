This place takes pride in its cleanliness and work. When I went for my third tattoo at a shop in Philadelphia (which I do NOT recommend) I returned here. Luke was my artist and a friend was so impressed with him, she got some color shading on a previous tattoo she received elsewhere (same place in Philly). I have plans to return in the fall to have him ""disguise"" another tattoo I have. I also plan to get a piercing...I hear Rachel is phenomenal. In summary, this place is clean and comfortable, professional and they do excellent work, while treating you like a nice person...all for very reasonable prices!

Whatever, the worst part was when I went back for a touch up (half the tattoo had faded significantly) myke didn't stand by his work, pretended to not know me initially, then said I would have to pay for the touch up. He tried to justify this by saying it's ""supposed"" to look like that. Like my tattoo is supposed to be halfway faded with some pieces scabbed off. I said he told me touch ups are free to which he responded ""I have bills to pay too, I have to charge, or you can schedule to get another tattoo and I'll touch it up then"" as if I would ever get another tattoo by him.

507398,0,0,ZZFqm6Pqdg5mmypwBcJ4zQ,"This was the only tattoo shop that made my fiancé, his 2 brothers and I pay first, which is very disrespectful and in my opinion was completely racist... My fiancé and his brothers are black and I'm white... There was an older white couple who was in there when we arrived, and they paid after the work was done, yet we had to pay before hand. The artist that did my fiancé's angel wing on his neck, shaved the back of my fiancé's neck and took off more hair than necessary which caused my fiancé to break out. It was funny though because I (who am white) was treated with more respect than the men I was with. The experience was the worst I've ever had, my fiancé agrees and he has been in 10+ shops within an hour radius and has 30+ tattoos. Also, my fiancés brother and I had both gotten a soda there, which each cost $1, they kepty fiancés brother's dollar yet gave back mine... Hmmm... I found this while doing some research.. ""Normally, in respectable tattoo shops, payment is due when services are rendered.  This means you pay when the session is finished, not before it has begun.  Large tattoos are paid for session by session, so you only pay for the work that was performed that day. (any shop that demands payment before the tattoo is done is probably accustomed to working with a shady clientele who are often trying to run out without paying.  This may mean that you are in a shady tattoo shop.  If you are shady yourself, or are okay with getting tattooed in a shady shop, stay put and carry on.  If you don't want to be tattooed in a shady shop, you might want to leave at this point).""

The Shop:
I've been in quite a few shops (I agonize over online portfolios and shop pictures trying to find the right spot for weeks), and the second I walked in I knew this one was different.  The waiting area has comfy couches, an indoor fish pond, and an actual shop manager to great you.  She was completely friendly, showed me where the portfolios were, left me alone, and said to come back and see her if I had any questions or saw an artist I liked.  It was that simple, no attitude or feeling like you're interrupting an artist just to check out the shop.  While checking out the books I was checking out the set up and liked how each artist had his own private area, but there was still an open communal feeling to the artists.  

The Artist:
I really liked John Howie's portfolio so I told the manager I was interested and she led me back to John and he was totally into what I wanted done.  I came back the next day for my appointment and had such an awesome experience.  He was so down to earth, again no attitude at all, it really felt like I was hanging out with a friend for a few hours.  Most importantly though, the work was just incredible.  He took what I wanted and just killed it.  I finally have a tattoo that I'm incredibly proud of.  Also, the price was more than fair for the quality of work done.  

If you're in the market for a tattoo I highly recommend checking out the shop.  I'm extremely picky and everything just clicked there and I'm so happy I went there.  Other shops when I step in I feel like the music record stops when you enter a party and everyone just stares, and this place was nothing like it.  Thanks for the great experience and awesome tattoo John!!",UQq4cdhjof93tuRyDm9-SQ,5.0,2012-07-06 01:04:06,G7mwiMt8O54z2Rl9smlW_Q,1,2012-07-06 01:04:06

2576989,0,0,fxUlFCPCdcuRYkm_lpL4Zw,"Ordered a tux for my son's senior prom.  My son changed his vest and bow tie color to match his girlfriend's dress better.  When my son went to put on the tux he realized the vest was still the original color he ordered.  We called and they said the change was made in the computer but couldn't really explain why we didn't get it.  I told them I would run down and pick up the color he ordered.  They put us on hold and came back saying they only had the bow tie in the color we ordered and they would give us a grey vest to match his tux.  I didn't understand why they didn't have the colors we ordered when it was in their system, but the prom was in a few hours and there was nothing we could do.  I drove to the store and picked up the bow tie that matched his girlfriend's dress and the grey vest that was the exact same color as his tux.  By the time I got back he should of been leaving to go to his girlfriend's house for pictures.  So he was already running late and when he went and put on the tux shirt he couldn't figure out why the cuff links wouldn't go on the sleeves.  Well it was because the shirt they gave him wasn't a tux shirt and didn't have the correct holes for cuff links.  My son was late getting to his girlfriend's house, which in turn made them late getting to their friend's house for pictures with their friends.  It is not the way you want you child's senior prom to start off like. 

When we took the tux back they said they would only take off for the vest since it wasn't the color he ordered.  That's all!  So I guess it didn't matter the tux shirt wasn't a tux shirt, and making an extra trip to the store because of a mistake they made was fine, and since my son was late for the group pictures, I didn't get to take many pictures of my son with all his friends.  Something he will never be able to do again since it was his senior prom.  All in all it was not a great experience and I taking off for the vest rental was the least they should have done.

She took our order for drinks and our appetizer but then after that became so slammed with other bar customers and other customers drink orders that coming back for our entree order was clearly forgotten. After we got our appetizer (which clearly sat under the heat lamp too long) we opted to leave instead of waiting around any longer. As we were paying we noticed the bartender venting to the manager about the lack of staffing and needing help- who instead of helping her gave her a very uncomfortably looking hug and walked away.

They almost always have some kind of special going on and it is just an all around good place to grab a bite when you don't want to spend a lot of money but still want a good burger, fajita or plate of nachos!

Wifey and I frequent this location and have always been pleased.  At one point Chili's was running a special -- if you check in at a Chili's in Foursquare you get a free chips and salsa.  I did so and asked my server... she had no idea what I was talking about.  But within minutes, she found out and credited us the cost -- easy as pie!",DGae0qGBtoE19egWaLYR4A,4.0,2011-02-23 18:12:12,rohwiags-kVO_IgYK1sIfw,0,2011-02-23 18:12:12

We went to enjoy a rare evening out on Valentines day. 


Our Waitress came over to us a total of three times the entire meal we were offered no refills. 


Our appetizer and main came out together after a 25-minute wait. once at the table, it was an additional 20 minutes to get my order corrected. (we had finished everything by then) this was done by the servers not the waitress the waitress did bring the final part of my order when it was done and was gone in a flash before i could say anything. 

no one checks with us to see if our food was prepared correctly. Half my order was missing.

after an additional 20 minutes waiting for our check i had an adjacent waitress go and find our waitress who then handed us a check and then walked away to the back again   Furious i just paid the check and left. 

I will be honest this was just about the worse service, I have ever experience. my wife refused to allow me to confront the staff at the time as i was just too darn mad to have anything constructive come of it.  

I would be very hard pressed to every return to this location again which is a shame because we enjoy Chilis.",DGae0qGBtoE19egWaLYR4A,1.0,2017-02-26 22:35:40,1OehPJ4IH5xCYG_J91u83w,0,2017-02-26 22:35:40

The salsa had just enough kick and the homemade chips were light and crispy. My bf had the ribs. He gave them a thumbs up. I had a buffalo chicken sandwich.

Most people only go there due to proximity, but I will pay the extra dollar in gas not to waste 2 more bucks of my money every day. Just to add, I stop at DD at least once or twice a day, and the other two establishments make the coffee perfect every time....and it is ordered the exact same way!

We sat down at the table after being sitting for around 15 minutes without anyone coming to us to take our drink order. They only came to us after we called someone over bringing it to their attention. We got our drinks and then they took our meal orders. 10 minutes later they bring back 6 dishes. Two of which we missing half of what it came with. Mine dish just not coming at all. We had to call them over once again because they forgot my order. We told them what was missing and they said they would get it tous. So they brought me my order some 8 minutes later. To the point the rest of the table was already done eating. After that they still forgot to bring the side dish for one of our dishes. The person ended up not even wanting it anymore since she had asked for it twice and had not received it. At the end of the meal we got the check and they still tried to charge us for the side dish that we never received. The waiter offered us no compensation for the various mistakes.

As the years have come and gone, my best friend moved to Europe so my dates have been replaced by my boyfriend, but I have always come back - this place has gone to crap. Specifically, the service. As I mentioned, the salsa is awesome. Probably why I keep coming back and why I ask for two containers of salsa when I order the tables chips and salsa. In the past maybe 10 times here, I would say twice the server remembered the second salsa. It would be all good if I didn't know any better. The main reason I ask for two is because I know the server isn't going to check on me after she gives me this food unless I track her down and ask for another.  I've also worked in food business for 10 years so I get it. But there really is no excuse to not give a lemon when someone asks for water or at least ask if you'd like one. It also takes a minimum of 7 minutes for our first drink and said chips and salsa. I don't think I was ever checked on after the food was given to us either. Refills? Might as well bring your own. 

If this was one specific server, it would be different. Not everyone is cut out to work in restaurants. It sucks but the money can be great.

They have classes of Spinning, Step Aerobics, Zumba, etc. This is not consistent either because the quality of trainers / professors do not have a standard, some of them are really bad.

So basically DO NOT waste your time at the Pottstown location its not worth it.,zVrKd23EbHay6SKKQp-1Kg,1.0,2017-01-20 13:33:04,Jc6oZaU58WcB_OK46cm-2w,0,2017-01-20 13:33:04

I told the membership person that I was joining my family member so he could train in the pool....at the time I joined (end of September) the pool heat was broken and still is not fixed!! I was never informed of that at the time I paid for my family member. Also, the girl stated it was best I joined now because prices were going to rise, when in fact I could now join with no initiation fee and the monthly fee is the same!!! In addition to this poor business practice there is equipment that has not been fixed for over a year such as the seats on the bikes........beware when joining here!",zVrKd23EbHay6SKKQp-1Kg,2.0,2018-10-22 16:19:45,lLLZ6WiTeYEZR-NyRRNtgQ,0,2018-10-22 16:19:45

If you are not some muscle head Caucasian you are treated  like and intruder. I took a spin class there one Tuesday  and it was the worst spin class i have ever been in, the music was horrible and by the time I left the class I had a splitting headache. If you are thinking of going to that gym and you are not white, good luck. I thought I would give it another chance but this is the last time I will ever go to that club. I would rather drive not the one in Bala Cynwyd than ever go back to that gym.",zVrKd23EbHay6SKKQp-1Kg,1.0,2012-08-08 01:50:47,zbuXFxWovWYg6GLd67B6-w,1,2012-08-08 01:50:47

I've taken evening spin classes and let me say, Jay is fng awesome.  Jay, if you read this, PLEASE go to Collegeville and run their spin program (or at minimum, educate the instructors on what constitutes a good playlist).

If other LA's are an indication, however, fast forward one year and this place will be in the shitter.  Sure hope I'm wrong; doubt I am.",zVrKd23EbHay6SKKQp-1Kg,4.0,2013-03-20 17:39:39,9wEZMCmuxJzbti6E5dZtAw,0,2013-03-20 17:39:39
